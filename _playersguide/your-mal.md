## What is your Master Adventurer's Log (MAL) ?

Your MAL is the single-source-of truth logging all pertinent activity for your character on the server.  Everything you gain (xp, gold, equipment) and spend on your character is logged here, so that we can make sure that we have a fair and even playing ground for everyone.


## What do you need to log in your MAL

- **Session Logs**  The results of a game session, including XP and DTP earned, gold and items gained (or used, etc.)
- **Downtime Logs** Downtime activities such as equipment purchases, crafting, bastion activities, etc.
- **Trade Logs** Trades with other members of the community


## Your first MAL entry

Once you've created your first character sheet, you should create add the character in your MAL.  The first row of each character should be a "character creation" session, which logs the character's initial XP and GP (depending on whether they start at level 3 or level 5), and starting equipment.  

- The MAL already defaults to starting level 3.  
- If you wish to create a level 5 character, add 5600XP and 600GP in your character creation entry.
- If you decided to purchase additional equipment (from the equipment tab on the Allowed Content), log the purchase under Downtime Log and add the inventory in the inventory sections.

### Initial Equipment purchases

Your character comes with initial gold and equipment based on the rules of the PHB.  Everything under the Equipment Tab of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> you can make purchases whenever you want.  In order to do so, you will need to make an entry in both your MAL and declare the transaction in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617830376257093640">#downtime-logs</a>.

Equipment Purchase Log:

In the inventory section of your MAL, add your equipment:

![Inventory Update]({{ '/assets/images/mal-inventory.png' | relative_url }})

Then in discord in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617830376257093640">#downtime-logs</a>, add an entry like this:

<code>mydiscord_id as character-name (level) spends xx GP to purchase goods</code>

Example:

<code>@player1 as Robin Hood (5) spends 35GP to purchase 1x Shortbow and 1x Leather Armor</code>

**Note:** that reselling equipment to the general market is at 50% value of the original purchase price.  You can also buy and sell goods to other players.  See section on Trades in Downtime Activities for more details.
