## 2024 Characters

As a player, you can create 2024 characters using the rules in the 2024 PHB and as per the character creation rules in this document described above and bearing the following in mind:

* **Compatibility**. Only 2024 PCs can use 2024 character options.

* **Older Options**. You must use the 2024 version of any character option and can’t use an older version unless no 2024 replacement of it exists. This includes classes, subclasses, species, feats, and spells (but does not apply to backgrounds as discussed below).

* **Languages**. You know Common and your choice of two other languages from the Allowed Content document except for Class Languages. You still can learn one free Ethnic Language in addition to this.

* **Customizing Backgrounds**. You can customize the listed 2024 Backgrounds: 

    * Replace the listed ASIs with +2/+1 to two different ability scores or +1/+1/+1 to three different ability scores. 
    * Choose an Origin Feat. 
    * Choose two different skills to be proficient in. 
    * Choose a tool proficiency to be proficient in.  

* **Older Backgrounds**. You can use older background options (including 2014 background options reprinted in 2024) and use the 2014 rules on Customizing a Background. If you use an older background option in this way, you gain +2/+1 to two different ability scores or +1/+1/+1 to three different ability scores. You also gain an Origin Feat (unless the selected background already provides a Feat).

* **Older Species**. If you use an eligible older species option, including Lineages from Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft, don’t apply any racial ASI bonuses. 

* **Official Updates**. Any 2024 characters created are subject to change as new source material is released by WOTC and players will receive a free full rework for affected characters as the need arises.

## 2024 Games

DMs can run games using the D&D 2024 ruleset described in the 2024 PHB and new sourcebooks as per the following:

* **Game Version**. DMs must indicate the ruleset to be used in the game by adding Game Version: 2014 or Game Version: 2024 to their ad in [#game-advertisement](https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/343396172293210112).
* **Player Characters**. Both PCs created using the 2014 or 2024 character options can play in a 2024 game.  2024 characters cannot play in 2014 games without versioning or the DM’s permission.
* **Spells**. The revised version of spells updated in the 2024 ruleset must be used in 2024 games. 2014 characters can use the older version of spells they cast at **DM discretion**. Outside of games, a character uses the version of the spell corresponding to their PC’s game version, unless no equivalent exists.
