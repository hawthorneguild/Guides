## Downtime Points

Between adventures, you can use Downtime Points (DTP) to perform different downtime activities. DTP is accrued by both players and DMs from sessions at a rate of 5 DTP per hour of the game (2 DTP for half hour). You can’t spend the same DTP on more than one activity, and DTP is player bound, meaning all of your PCs share a common pool of DTP. Except where otherwise stated, the minimum DTP for any activity is 1.

All DTP and gold expenditure must be logged in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617830376257093640">#downtime-logs</a>, with a corresponding update in your MAL. (Some activities are logged in other channels)

## Downtime Activities

The following is a summary of available Downtime Activities. For details on each activity, refer to the Downtime sheet of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> document.

### Buying and Selling

You can buy and sell items as listed. The purchase limit in Hawthorne is 15,000 GP, with more expensive items available in Waterdeep or other major cities.  Purchasing items on the equipment list in the Allowed Content can be logged in #downtime-channel and in your MAL under downtime. 

```PlayerDiscord as Character (level) purchases <list items> for <amount> gp```

### Bastions

You can construct and use a Bastion and its facilities. See Appendix B and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> for details.

### Crafting

You can craft equipment and magic items. Except where otherwise stated, crafting equipment requires proficiency in a corresponding tool, costs DTP equal to the item cost / 25, and costs half the item price in gold, plus additional DTP for crafting magical items.   You must have a bastion with the requisite facilities and your character must have the requisite tool skills to craft items.  For crafting items that produce spell effects (e.g. spellwrought tattoos or wands), your character must be able to cast that spell.

Only T1 or below items are craftable.

See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> under Equipment or Loot to see crafting requirements per item.

### Research

You can conduct Research as described in *Xanathar’s Guide to Everything* as presided over by a DM.

### Reworking

You can rework your character in the listed ways. All reworks must be logged in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617833245433921556">#character-rework-log</a> for approval by an Auditor, with all reworks logged in your MAL in the session section. You can fully refund any rework prior to your first game played or DMPCed with that character, as well as a partial refund (50% GP and DTP recouped) prior to your 3rd game. Log the refund in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617833245433921556">#character-rework-log</a> for approval by an Auditor.

### Spellcasting

You can cast a spell with a lasting effect or copy a spell.  Note that Hawthorne has a community spellbook to copy spells from and into located at Hawthorne University. See the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/446756816186245120">#hawthorne-university</a> channel.

### Spellcasting Services

You can purchase spellcasting services for the listed level 0 - 5 spells in Hawthorne. Outside of Hawthorne, villages offer up to level 2 spells and towns and cities offer up to level 5 spells.

### Trading

You can trade items with other PCs. Only PCs in the same location can trade with each other and any items you obtain via trading with another PC must be of your PC’s tier or lower. All trades must be logged in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617832619689902100">#trade-logs</a> and both players’ MALs must be updated with the corresponding entries.

**Note**: You can’t trade gold or equipment that can be sold for gold between your PCs, even by proxy or cross character trade (such as trading an item from one of your PCs and receiving an item on another PC).

You can list your items for trade in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617822091164516405">#trade-listing</a>.  But please observe the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/308324031478890497/617822091164516405/1424311899843068005">rules for posts</a> in this channel.

### Training

You learn a new language, tool proficiency, or acquire expertise with a tool. Another PC that knows a language or tool proficiency can teach you provided they’re in the same location, with you expending the DTP but no gold, while the teacher expends half the DTP.

### Traveling

You travel to another location of the world. Travel costs 1 DTP and 1 GP per day and uses the rules in the PHB and DMG for traveling at a normal pace for a maximum of 8 hours per day. A list of common locations is below.
