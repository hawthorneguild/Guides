## Server Code of Conduct

**Compliance with Discord Rules**  
All server members must comply with the Discord Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.  Violations can result in immediate server ban.

### Respect

All server members should treat each other with respect. You are not required to be friends but should treat each other in ways that help create an atmosphere of positivity and integrity.

**No Harassment**. Harassment of other players is not tolerated, which includes: name calling, spreading rumors, publicly disparaging others, abuse of Discord’s private message or pinging features, stalking, trolling, or passive aggressive comments.

Sexual harassment is grounds for immediate server ban, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and persistent conduct of a sexual nature despite objections from the affected party.

**No Disruptive Behavior**.  Disruptive behavior includes racism, sexism, bigotry of any kind, backseat DMing, and interrupting another player’s scene or injecting yourself into it without the DM or player’s consent.

### Privacy

Do not share the personal information or private messages of others without their permission. The only exceptions are to contact PR with this information if there is a concern for the health and safety of another player or to provide evidence if you are being harassed.

The server’s Privacy Policy can be found [here]({{ '/rules/privacy-policy/' | relative_url }}).

### Integrity

All server members must avoid cheating. Cheating includes: reworking your character sheet without Auditor approval, falsifying or neglecting your MAL, and intentionally misrepresenting the contents of your character sheet or MAL to DMs or other players.

### PvP Requires Affirmative Consent

Player vs Player (PvP) activity, whether in session or in the roleplay channels, requires affirmative informed consent from all parties. Initiating PvP also means you consent to PvP in retaliation. Anyone wishing to engage in PvP must talk to other involved players and the DM if there is one and the resolution of PvP activities must be mutually agreed upon by all involved players.

### Useable Content

Content created on the server was designed by server members for use on the server. A server member that steals original content on the server to publish elsewhere or as part of a competing Discord server can be subject to a PR investigation and server ban.

### Contacting Player Relations

If you ever have a concern that another player is violating the Code of Conduct or if you and another player are in a dispute that makes treating each other with Respect difficult, please message a member of PR to communicate your concerns so they can help resolve the issue instead of infighting. You can additionally file an Incident Report to be reviewed by PR.

### Disciplinary Actions

In the event a server member repeatedly or intentionally violates the Code of Conduct above, the PR team may open an investigation, contacting affected parties in order to determine a course of action. The following potential disciplinary outcomes are listed in order of severity.

| Action | Description |
|:------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verbal Counseling** | The PR team discusses and mediates the matter with affected parties in order to resolve the issue and provides steps to avoid repeat incidents without additional disciplinary measures. |
| **Timeout** | A Discord timeout up to 1 week, due to disruptive behavior or Code of Conduct violation. |
| **Warning** | A warning period up to 6 months, due to Code of Conduct breach and/or failure in mediation or verbal counseling to achieve desired results. This warning can be accompanied by other disciplinary actions, with further incidents prompting discussion and vote for removal of DM or Staff tags, extension of the warning period, Suspension, Removal from the Server, or other disciplinary actions. |
| **Suspension** | A server ban up to 180 days, which can be coupled with a Warning consecutively afterward. |
| **Removal from the Server** | A server ban lasting at least 180 days. |
