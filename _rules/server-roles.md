## Server Roles and Hierarchy

All registered members of the server have the <span class="role-adventurer">Adventurer</span> role. Adventurers that have played at least one game on the server can register as a DM and obtain the <span class="role-trial-dm">Trial DM</span> role. Trial DMs that have run several games on the server can apply for and obtain the <span class="role-full-dm">Full DM</span> role, granting additional DMing privileges on the server. In addition to players and DMs are members of <span class="role-staff">Staff</span> that help oversee and manage different aspects of the server.

### Staff Teams

There are six Staff teams:

* <span class="role-auditor">**Auditors**</span> and <span class="role-auditor-apprentice">**Auditor Apprentices**</span> oversee character reworks and help ensure server logs are accurate.

* <span class="role-lore">**Lore Consultants**</span> and <span class="role-lore-apprentice">**Lore Apprentices**</span> handle all matters about setting and server specific lore and assist players and DMs in being consistent with both.

* <span class="role-pr">**Player Relations**</span> oversees player/DM registration as well as handling server disputes and incident reports, including disciplinary action if necessary.

* <span class="role-rules">**Rule Architects**</span> and <span class="role-rules-apprentice">**Rule Apprentices**</span> handles all matters about official and server specific rules and mechanics, as well as allowed content on the server.

* <span class="role-engineer">**Engineers**</span> and <span class="role-engineer-apprentice">**Engineers Apprentices**</span> maintain the server's bots and backend and sites.

* <span class="role-admin">**Admins**</span> oversee the running and management of the server in collaboration with the other Staff teams.
