This script converts a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file containing FAQs
into a structured YAML file, suitable for use in static site generators
like Jekyll.

It is designed to be run from the project root or from its own directory.
It handles multi-line answers by converting literal '\n' strings from the TSV
into proper YAML block scalars (|).

# --- Configuration ---
# This section defines the file paths dynamically and robustly, so the
# script can be run from any location.

# `Path(__file__)` is a special variable that gets the path to this script file.
# `.resolve()` gets the full, absolute path (e.g., /Users/me/Project/tools/convert.py)
script_file = Path(__file__).resolve()

# `.parent` gets the directory containing the file.
# `script_dir` will be /Users/me/Project/tools

# `project_root` assumes the script is one level deep (in /tools)
# and goes up one level to get the project's root directory.
# `project_root` will be /Users/me/Project
project_root = script_dir.parent

# `pathlib` lets us use the `/` operator to build paths that work
# on any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
# This creates a solid, absolute path to the data files.
