On the Material Plane, they are most commonly seen in the service of powerful demons and other evil creatures that use them as trackers and hunters.\n\n### Crawling Flesh\nA chaos hound appears to be a large hound whose flesh crawls ceaselessly across its body. Upon closer inspection, the creature can be more accurately seen as a decaying hound with a jet-black skeleton covered by maggots that squirm as they await their next meal. When moving the hound becomes insubstantial, appearing as a ghostly blur that leaves behind a lingering scent of decay. The maggots that make up its flesh ooze acid at all times; this acid leaves pools wherever the chaos hound stands. When the chaos hound feeds on a corpse, the maggots from its body swarm to feast. Gorged and bloated, they reattach to the chaos hound, causing it to look fat and agitated.  The chaos hound gives off an aura of decay. The smell can be detected from hundreds of feet away and lingers for hours after its passing.\n\n### Relentless Trackers\nChaos hounds are vicious fiends that **relentlessly track** their prey. Once they have the scent of a target, they will not stop until they are slain or their prey is consumed. When the chaos hound devours its target, it not only consumes the flesh but also the **soul**.\n\n### Devourer of Souls\nA chaos hound may feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both the flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the chaos hound for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the chaos hound dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released. While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a chaos hound, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the chaos hound if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, the creature may only be returned to life by a wish spell or divine intervention.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":36,"speed":"50 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 14, \"CON\": 17, \"DEX\": 15, \"INT\": 8, \"STR\": 20, \"WIS\": 16}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 6, \"STR\": 9, \"WIS\": 7}","skills":"Perception +7, Survival +7","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Necrotic; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from non-magical weapons","damage_immunities":"Acid","senses":"Truesight 30 ft., Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 17","languages":"Understands Abyssal but can't speak","cr":"10.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:18.95299+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:18.95299+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Poisoned"},{"row_id":"1d8e8773-8ee9-48ab-815b-a685dfe0a7a7","monster_id":"e669a98b-5163-425a-ab6e-13b9bf84a6fe","version":"1.0","slug":"hollow-archer","name":"Hollow Archer","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"ead9d423-93c6-4d1f-ad76-195dd4764e53","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Undead","alignment":"Neutral Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":14,"conditional_ac":"(chain shirt)","hit_dice_num":7,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":14,"speed":"30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 5, \"CON\": 15, \"DEX\": 13, \"INT\": 6, \"STR\": 13, \"WIS\": 8}","saves":"{}","skills":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 9","languages":"Understands all languages it knew in life but can't speak","cr":"0.500","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:24.640647+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:24.640647+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Exhaustion"},{"row_id":"1e1eb754-ff26-4482-8544-cf048bc8b773","monster_id":"a70085c7-7bec-4892-9e95-1bcb7ae23d2c","version":"1.0","slug":"sultan-rezzo-the-marvelous","name":"Sultan Rezzo the Marvelous","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Full DM Only","creator_id":"701fe051-c4b3-43bc-a8dc-1bf03684bdbb","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Elemental","alignment":"chaotic neutral","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"Sultan Rezzo is a noble marid who reigns in a magnificent palace in the Elemental Plane of Water. He occasionally gives quests to Hawthorne Guild members. As long as the Hawthorne Guild remains in good standing with the Sultan, the guild will have freedom of access to the portal leading to an area near his palace in the Elemental Plane of Water.\n\nSultan Rezzo is a kind and benevolent Marid as long as he is given the respect he considers himself to deserve. Otherwise, his fury can be as violent as the ocean when a storm causes waves to crash and sink ships and anyone inside it. He is the benevolent ruler of his palace, he gives his slaves many liberties and treats them fairly well. He is more interested in having slaves for the sake of ownership than actually making them do anything they wouldn't want to. However, it seems pretty clear that his slaves are quite happy with their lives and are staying in the palace of their own will. Among those slaves, his two favorites are Brooke the Swift, a water genasi, and Aukai the Wanderer, a sea elf. They often serve as his messengers and emissaries.\n\n### Sultan Rezzo's Palace\nSultan Rezzo's palace is a grandiose building covered in coral and algae. It is filled with wonders and sensory delights that goes beyond one's wildest dreams. This opulent palace floats in a deep part of the Plane of Water and contains many luxurious chambers and rooms filled with air for his guests or slaves.\n\n### Roleplaying Sultan Rezzo\nRezzo is a Marid who sees himself as a superior being and expects to be treated as such. He wears fine and colorful clothes that resemble outfits usually seen in the Calimshan region.\n\nRezzo has a great sense of self-importance, and considers himself, as well as other Marids, above all other kinds of genies. He tolerates djinn, dislikes dao, and despises efreet. Bribery and flattery are the best means for a humanoid to earn Rezzo's favor. In an adventuring group, whoever praises him the most will be seen by Rezzo as the most intelligent or worthy of the group and assume they are the leader. Rezzo loves to tell stories about himself or legends he knows, and although he will not directly lie about the events he recounts, he will greatly embellish them. He hates being interrupted while telling his stories, and will only offer a single warning before unleashing his wrath should this great offense be done to him.\n\n***Personality Trait.*** There's nothing I like more than finding a new skillful slave.\n\n***Ideal.*** Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good)\n\n***Bond.*** I will do anything to prove myself superior to other genies.\n\n***Flaw.*** Flattery brings down my defenses and I tend to be less cautious of those who compliment me.\n\n***Quirk.*** I will always invite the one I deem most worthy in an adventuring group to join my kingdom as a slave.\n\n#### Additional Notes\n- Sultan Rezzo's crown is a ***helm of telepathy***. He frequently scans the surface thoughts of his guests to try and gauge them.\n- Rezzo is a difficult individual to gauge or read and attempts to magically discern his thoughts or know if he is lying are foiled by his ***ring of mind shielding***.\n- He continually maintains the ***tongues*** spell on himself to be able to speak with all manner of visitors from across the planes without issue.\n- He has three ***sending stones*** linked to servants of his court on his person at all times.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[\"Boss\"]","ac":19,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":17,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":136,"speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft., swim 90 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 20, \"CON\": 26, \"DEX\": 12, \"INT\": 18, \"STR\": 24, \"WIS\": 18}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 10, \"DEX\": 6, \"WIS\": 9}","skills":"Arcana +9, Deception +10, History +9, Insight +9, Perception +9, Persuasion +10","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 19","languages":"Aquan, Common","cr":"16.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-05 20:36:21.752558+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:30.168005+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":null},{"row_id":"1e533b02-fd55-4815-8964-c90b9b3cce37","monster_id":"524c3252-eed0-4f49-89d2-e653242e13ff","version":"1.0","slug":"gobblervoki","name":"Gøbblervøki","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"33456f74-173a-49eb-8226-5fbe05b69a3b","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/6ec0d49d-038d-4900-b498-c8cc3863c8e8/d9y5ee4-56c859a1-5709-42ac-984c-86f0b4a5b77b.jpg/v1/fill/w_900,h_632,q_75,strp/jabberwocky_by_irenhorrors_d9y5ee4-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NjMyIiwicGF0aCI6Ii9mLzZlYzBkNDlkLTAzOGQtNDkwMC1iNDk4LWM4Y2MzODYzYzhlOC9kOXk1ZWU0LTU2Yzg1OWExLTU3MDktNDJhYy05ODRjLTg2ZjBiNGE1Yjc3Yi5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9OTAwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.YCB6KhNlusZ-66oXCUv2g2nG75NcFh7eqgyJVpEn4-0","image_credit":"Iren Horrors","token_url":null,"size":"Large","species":"Monstrosity","alignment":"Lawful Evil","alignment_prefix":"typically","description":"A Gøbblervøki is created from the shadow of a mortal that becomes lost in the Feywild.

Cruel and capricious, they take great joy in the cold, frigid death of others, and will play elaborate games with the lives of those passing through their lands. Lurking near mountain tops or in arctic terrain, they delight in tormenting helpless creatures and subsist on the body heat that they drain from victims.\n\n**Deadly Shapechangers**. Jack frosts have several forms and can change from one to another at will. They may appear as a flurry of beautiful and intricately patterned snowflakes, a vaporous white cloud, or as small, pale blue fey with silver eyes and white or silvery icicle-like hair. Even in the heaviest snow or coldest region, they wear only gauzy white clothing and go barefoot. Those who might be identified as males wear tunics and trousers, while those regarded as females\nprefer gowns. They all have mischievous, beguiling smiles, and speak their own language amongst themselves.\n\n**Chilling Predators**. In their snowflake forms, jack frosts are so beautiful that anyone viewing them falling from the sky and tumbling about are typically hypnotized by their loveliness. Once they have gotten close to their victims through this ruse, these ice spirits are seen as clouds of freezing vapor, and it is not uncommon for several jack frosts to combine and create a larger cloud. In this form they are able to sweep across their victims, chilling them to their very core.\nAfter the initial attack, they have been known to change into their true forms to touch victims with chilling grasps, or to nip them with freezing, numbing bites. A jack frost’s touch sends a searing, freezing shock through its victim’s body that drains them of their body heat and prevents them from moving.  A bite from the jack frost renders the part bitten numb, and the favored targets for a jack frost’s bite are the lips, nose, ears, fingertips and the toes. The jack frost’s nip causes frostbite, and if the injured region is not properly tended to within the hour through gentle warming or the like, the part will have to be amputated as gangrene will set in.\n\n**Arctic Wanderers**. Jack frosts wander the arctic landscape seeking nourishment in the form of body heat and amusement in the torment of mortals, possessing several powers that endanger travelers in the regions they inhabit.  They have no true society as such, existing to play elaborate games. Their thought processes are completely alien to mortals, being composed of strange yearnings and sly, incomprehensible ploys to “win” the latest game, whatever it may be.\n\n**Unusual Ecology**. Jack frosts have no true sexes and reproduce by warming to the point of melting and reforming as two creatures. They often take treasure gained from former victims and strew it about to attract other prey to their current wandering grounds. Other than this, however, they have no use for such trinkets.\n\n#### Frostbite\nThis disease affects a creature bitten by a jack frost, in which symptoms occur 1d4 hours after infection and involves gangrene setting into a bitten body part. Before the symptoms occur, the infected creature must be tended to by gentle warming lasting for at least 10 minutes, or by spells or effects that remove disease. If not treated, the infected creature gains a **Lingering Injury** and the disease is then removed.","additional_info":"## Combat Tactics\n\nThe jack frost is an agile creature that should be played as a malicious troublemaker that can make life miserable for the party. When engaging in combat, the jack frost should use its flight speed and flyby to weave in and out of range when making attacks, and make use of its spells from range. The jack frost should never touch the ground if it can help it nor end its turn directly next to a creature if possible. If any characters are heavily armoured or heavy hitters, ensure that the jack frost avoids coming into direct contact with them, stays flying at least 20 feet above the ground, and engages with softer targets. Any creatures that can deal fire damage should be prioritized, and any creature that manages to reach the jack frost in melee should be given the Cold Shoulder.\n\n### Ambush Tactics\n\nWith a Stealth of +8, a jack frost should be very difficult to spot as it can easily camouflage itself up near clouds in its mist form (passive perception DC 23 to spot). Even if spotted, the party would only see a cloud of dazzling snowflakes in the air.  If the jack frost has managed to sneak up on the party in mist form without any of them noticing, it should cast hypnotic pattern to catch as many surprised party members as possible. Any creatures that are not caught in the effect should then be prioritised and finished off.\n\n### Engaging Tactics \n\nThe jack frost won't survive long against a well-equipped party, so its abilities need to be used to outmanoeuvre and deal with the most challenging party members. Even though\na jack frost is not a genius, it is still intelligent and malicious enough to know how to make the use of its abilities. \n\nIf the party is either clustered, caught in a place with little to no room to move, or on difficult terrain (such as ice or deep snow), the jack frost should use its Polar Midnight to catch as many creatures as possible. With Polar Midnight active, the party should be struggling to see if they have no magical light sources or darkvision, and they should be taking damage each turn they remain inside. Any creatures that are sheathed in ice can be ignored unless they have fire damage or threatening abilities. Once Polar Midnight is active, the jack frost should then keep to the air and engage with softer targets. Cone of Cold can be used with Polar Midnight active, causing high damage to the party if they are still clustered together. If the party moves well outside of Polar Midnight (and the jack frost cannot catch any more by moving it), Wall of Ice should be used to split off members of the party.\n\nTrapping either casters or the heavy hitters behind the wall can allow the jack frost to engage against its highest priority targets. If the jack frost isn't concentrating on Polar Midnight or one of its big spells, it should use its heat metal on any armoured characters.  \n\nThe jack frost's regeneration should be made use of as much as possible by making it use hit and run tactics. Always assume that a jack frost is fighting at a disadvantage against a\nparty of adventurers. If a fight isn't going well, a jack frost should retreat by dashing well away and breaking line of sight. After all, it can heal up and always engage a wounded\nparty later on if they encounter other threats. If it has managed to land frostbite on a party member, the jack frost should then try to pursue the party at a distance and prevent\nthem from treating it with heat properly. \n\n### Terrain\n\nThe jack frost works best in terrain that is difficult for the party, such as deep snow, ice, or even blizzards. The party should be fearful of being set upon by roaming monsters in\nsuch dangerous situations, which makes the job much easier for the jack frost.  Caves are also hunting grounds for jack frosts, for they can hide in the shadows and trap creatures with their Polar Midnight or wall of ice, and retreat to cover that breaks line of sight.\n\n### Minions and Allies\nJack frosts typically hang around in groups, called flurries, to show off their maliciousness to each other, and they work best when they are not alone. A jack frost hunts with its kin against more powerful foes, or it could be acting alone by using the wilderness and other creatures against the party. Packs of roaming winter wolves, yeti, remorhaz, or other\narctic threats can easily become more dangerous if a jack frost decides to fly by.  \n\nAlternatively, the jack frost can be paired with other creatures that it could efficiently work with (or deceive) such as Frost Giants, Bheur Hags or White Dragons.

After all, a jack frost thrives on its cruelty onto others and having its machinations undermine the party's efforts is what it lives for.","tags":"[]","ac":19,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":16,"hit_dice_size":6,"hp_modifier":64,"speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft.

I raised objections to the name he used for them, but he refused to entertain any of my reasonable suggestions for alternatives. For his insistence, I made him eat every page of his manuscript that contained the objectionable word. Harsh, perhaps, but it had to be done.\"*  \n*- Clathaldion, silver dragon.*\n\nMost scholars, naturalists, and dwarven armory guards on the material plane think they have a pretty good understanding of the rust monster life cycle. They hatch from eggs, feed on ferrous metals until the time comes to molt, and then they repeat the process until they die. Unfortunately, that's not quite the complete picture.\n\nA rust monster that grows old enough will try to make its way to **Avalas**, the first layer of the outer plane **Acheron**. It's a mystery how they manage it: perhaps it's simply luck, or perhaps they have an instinctual sense for finding portals to that plane. It's a major obstacle in either case: of the rare rust monsters that survive to old age, only a few ever find their way to Acheron. Those that do discover paradise. For a year, the creatures gorge themselves on the innards of the titanic iron cubes of that realm, carving out some of its tunnels. When they have eaten enough, the rust monsters fashion cocoons out of spun metal in which they undergo a three-year metamorphosis. When this process is complete, the rust monster emerges in a wholly new form: that of a **rust dragon**.\n\nIn appearance, rust dragons closely resemble true dragons - specifically metallic dragons - except they are more insectile in appearance. They have antennae rather than horns, their teeth are actually jagged extensions of their exoskeleton, and their flight is powered by butterfly wings. Their skin is pitted and corroded-looking (though no less protective for it), splotched with orange, brown, and blood-red highlights. A rust dragon's color is that of a type of metallic dragon's metal namesake, except oxidized.\n\nNeedless to say, it is these visual similarities that have earned them the name 'rust dragons' by humanoids who know of them. As the above anecdote demonstrates, true dragons tend to feel quite insulted by this comparison. After all, they'll say, rust 'dragons' aren't nearly as intelligent, wise, elegant, magical, humble, or even as reptilian as them. And though the similarities are a little more than skin-deep - rust dragons have most of the same physical capabilities as dragons - they clearly lack the innate magic of true dragons. Spellcasting doesn't come naturally to them, and neither do they have the kind of influence on their environments that true dragons do.\n\nThey do have breath weapons, which is enough to drive fear into a great deal of mortals - dragons included. Their acid breath is useful for personal defense, but the real danger for warriors and hoarders is their **corrosive breath**. Unlike rust monsters, rust dragons seem capable of corroding any metal into tasty rusty flakes.\n\n#### Lifestyle\nRust dragons, even more so than their pre-metamorphosis kin, tend to be solitary creatures. They don't often interact with fellow rust dragons while roaming Acheron and when they do they quickly become embroiled in a nonfatal struggle for dominance, where the victor is the one that places its jaws around the other's head or neck.\n\nThey don't keep a hoard and rarely lair in one place, preferring to wander according to their whim. An elder rusty might keep a few choice gems and some other nonmetal items that catch its eye, as well as any magical metal items it can't corrode and digest. Rust dragons aren't typically hostile to strangers and they're intelligent enough to understand trade. They place little value on things they can't eat, and they value metals by how tasty they find them (the rarer the better, usually). It's often possible to 'buy off' a rust dragon with a sufficient quantity of precious metal, though beware that rust dragons aren't immune to greed (or gluttony, rather) either.\n\n#### Out of Acheron\nMost rust dragons prefer to stay in Acheron, but they do on occasion find their way elsewhere. Here are some suggestions for how that might occur.\n\n| d6  | How did the rust dragon get here? |\n|:---:|:-----------------------------------|\n|  1  | The rusty found a sufficient quantity of metal in the material plane to carry out its metamorphosis there. |\n|  2  | Someone desperately cast a *plane shift* spell on the rusty to prevent it from disarming their whole army. |\n|  3  | The rusty left in search of tastier metals. |\n|  4  | An ill-informed archmage summoned the rusty using a *gate* spell and it promptly rusted through its cage. |\n|  5  | A spiteful chromatic dragon lured the rusty here to torment metallics. |\n|  6  | The rusty stumbled through a portal by accident and can't find its way back home. |\n\n#### Rust Dragon Connections\nIn Acheron, there is a race of 15-foot tall, highly intelligent quadrupedal birds known as **Achaierai** who sometimes gather rust dragon cocoons, tend to them carefully, and raise the emerging rust dragons as beloved pets and prized tunnelers. Rust dragons raised this way are much more sociable with other rust dragons as well.\n\nHere are some more examples of connections a rust dragon might form with other creatures.\n\n| d8  | Connection |\n|:---:|:-----------|\n|  1  | A militant druid tries to bond with this rusty, hoping to use it to purge manufactured metal from this world. |\n|  2  | An adventuring band travels with a rusty that they keep docile by feeding it electrum coins and looted gear. |\n|  3  | A brass dragon tries to teach a rusty how to act like a proper dragon, far away from its own hoard. |\n|  4  | A rusty shepherds a group of rust monsters through life. |\n|  5  | A duergar leader promises an adamantine reward to a rusty if it destroys the armory of their enemies. |\n|  6  | An artist is enamored with the patterns and colors of a rusty's exoskeleton 'skin'. |\n|  7  | A scholar is determined to study rust dragons, even under threats and harassment by true dragons. |\n|  8  | A rusty bound or hired to guard a dungeon is constantly tormented by hunger for its construct colleagues. |","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":14,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":56,"speed":"40 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 60 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 13, \"CON\": 18, \"DEX\": 14, \"INT\": 6, \"STR\": 19, \"WIS\": 15}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 5, \"CON\": 8, \"DEX\": 6, \"WIS\": 6}","skills":"Perception +10, Stealth +6","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Blindsight 30 ft., Darkvision 90 ft., Passive Perception 20","languages":"Typically speaks and understands Common","cr":"10.000","legendary_header":"The rust dragon can take 2 legendary actions, using the options below.

These dragons don’t share their parents’ usual traits and are often abandoned after displaying an appetite for consuming enchanted weaponry.\n\n**Sharp Appearance.** A sword dragon’s body appears forged from countless bladed weapons, with scales resembling sharpened daggers that lengthen as the creature ages. Their scales evolve from heavy iron in wyrmlings, to tempered steel in young dragons, to lightweight mithral in adults, and finally hardened adamantine in ancients. Magical consumption grants them formidable new abilities, making them truly epic foes.\n\n---\n\n### Customizing a Sword Dragon\n\nTo customize a sword dragon, start with the base stat block for its age category (wyrmling, young, adult, or ancient). Then, roll once on each previous age category’s table to add traits, beginning from wyrmling up to its current age.  \n\nIf a trait doesn’t specify a saving throw DC, use the dragon’s breath weapon DC.\n\n#### Sword Dragon Wyrmling Traits\n\n| d4 | Trait Name | Description |\n|:--:|:------------|:-------------|\n| 1 | **Alert** | The dragon has advantage on initiative rolls, and neither it nor its allies within 30 ft. can be surprised. |\n| 2 | **Dominating** | The dragon can cast *command* and *dominate beast* at will via Innate Spellcasting. |\n| 3 | **Vengeful** | The dragon can use its reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that damaged it. |\n| 4 | **Wrathful** | When the dragon hits a target, creatures of its choice within 5 ft. of that target take 5 (2d4) slashing damage. |\n\n#### Young Sword Dragon Traits\n\n| d4 | Trait Name | Description |\n|:--:|:------------|:-------------|\n| 1 | **Baneful** | The dragon has advantage on attack rolls against a chosen kind of creature, which also has disadvantage on saving throws against the dragon’s breath weapon. |\n| 2 | **Draining** | Once per turn, the dragon deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains that many temporary hit points. |\n| 3 | **Metamorphic** | The dragon can use a bonus action to gain resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning until it changes again. Its attacks and breath weapon match this damage type. |\n| 4 | **Vicious** | On a critical hit, the dragon rolls damage dice three times instead of twice. |\n\n#### Adult Sword Dragon Traits\n\n| d4 | Trait Name | Description |\n|:--:|:------------|:-------------|\n| 1 | **Commanding** | Once per turn, the dragon enables one creature within 60 ft. to make a weapon attack, move up to its speed, or take the Dodge action as a reaction. |\n| 2 | **Sharpened** | When the dragon reduces a creature to 0 HP, it severs a limb or portion of the creature’s body. |\n| 3 | **Slaying** | When the dragon hits a creature with 100 HP or fewer, it can force a DC 15 Constitution save or the creature dies instantly. |\n| 4 | **Swift** | The dragon can make one extra attack as a bonus action each turn. |\n\n#### Ancient Sword Dragon Traits\n\n| d4 | Trait Name | Description |\n|:--:|:------------|:-------------|\n| 1 | **Avenging** | The dragon’s attacks deal +11 (2d10) radiant damage. The dragon and its allies within 30 ft. have advantage on saving throws against spells. |\n| 2 | **Lucky** | The dragon has advantage on all saving throws and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or save per turn (must use the new roll). |\n| 3 | **Reshaping** | The dragon gains a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. On its first attack each turn, it may transfer some or all of this bonus to its AC until its next turn. |\n| 4 | **Vorpal** | The dragon’s attacks and breath ignore resistance to piercing/slashing.

As they did so, their numbers grew wider; when a fech would enter a humanoid's dreams, the mortal was likely to dream of a fech again afterwards. These creatures like to feed on dreams and nightmares, but are more satisfied when feeding upon nightmares.\n\nThe fech, having been created from the spirits of gremlins of the Autumn Court, are fierce combatants in their own right, and will fight other dream-eaters for access to plentiful feeding grounds.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":13,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":52,"speed":"40 ft., fly 40 ft.

The tiny 'sleep' found on a person's eyes upon waking is supposedly the magical sand or grit sprinkled into a sleeping child’s eyes to get them to sleep peacefully. For the children that are particularly naughty and refuse to fall asleep, the Sandman's \"sleep\" causes their eyes to fall out, which are then collected and put away in his sack. The Sandman is then said to steal away the naughty child to his castle on the moon, as sustenance for his offspring. Some parents ameliorate the tale so that the Sandman is said to be a supportive but still a capricious helper, using the threat of the Sandman to coerce wakeful children into sleeping. However, the softening of the tale about the mysterious being is a kindness to the Sandman's true nature.\n\n#### Dark Origin\nThe Sandman is a mysterious entity, and many theories exist about his origin. The most commonly accepted story was that the Sandman was once a brilliant arcanist that was unable to have children of his own. After many years of work he attempted to make the perfect daughter through magic. However, she was never fully 'alive'but was a construct with an uncanny appearance and no empathy for those around her. The arcanist, unable to bear the sight of others looking at his glassy-eyed daughter with disdain, would kidnap people to enact his wrath and his daughter's cruel wishes. After many years, some mysterious powers recognized the evil acts they both performed, and they were pulled into a demesne bordering the **Region of Dreams** and the **Demiplane of Nightmares**. When he was cast away to this border region, the Sandman lost all sense of self, becoming a haunting, dishevelled being.\n\n#### Nightly Visitor\nThe Sandman is said to reside in a wondrous castle that overlooks a sea of liquid sand and is filled with hundreds of life-like, servant constructs. He exists only to serve his daughter, changing the very landscape of his domain to please her, and fetching whatever she desires. Each night, the Sandman scours the planes to haunt people in their sleep and to learn more about those that exist outside of his realm. On occasion, he escapes from his domain and into the world, stealing wakeful children and bringing them to his residence so they can forever reside with his false daughter.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":20,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":40,"speed":"40 ft., fly 30 ft.

Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until he chooses to make them unlocked, or until he uses this lair action again to open them.\n* The Sandman selects terrain, one creature, or one object that is part of an illusion spell that he has cast and makes it real for 1 minute. A creature made real in this way has a CR of 4 or below and rolls its own initiative in combat, acting independently of the Sandman but always obeys his commands. Any hazardous terrain made real in this way deals 4d10 damage of an appropriate damage type, with DC 17 for any associated saving throws of an appropriate type.

As long as he can see his duplicate, the Sandman can move it a distance equal to his walking speed as well as make the duplicate speak on his turn (no action required). The duplicate has the same statistics as the Sandman but can’t take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The duplicate seems real in every way but crumbles into sand if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the Sandman dismisses it (no action required) or if he can no longer see it.

While sharing many characteristics with their more cruel and spiteful abyssal-speaking cousins, faerie linnorms are shaped by the potent magic of their home plane, which grants them unique powers and abilities, including the empowerment and distortion of magic that is cast around them.\n\n#### Bargain Burners\n\nMost other linnorm subspecies are infamously honorless and untrustworthy creatures that are known to go back on deals, but to a fey, their word is their bond. It is perhaps true that the first linnorms to find themselves within the Feywild lied and mooched their way through the four courts, but over time, that disdain for deals morphed under faerie magic. Today, linnorms native to the Feywild, like all other faeries, must **uphold the bargains they make**, but they possess the special power to unilaterally end fey deals struck by others—except those made with **Baba Yaga**. Faerie and mortal alike travel far and wide to beseech the local faerie linnorm to end their fey agreement. If the linnorm agrees, it burns the literal contract or something that symbolizes the deal, and the agreement ends without magical consequence for the breacher—though the other party may still seek just reparation for the unjust enrichment.\n\n#### Reclusive Nature\n\nLike the majority of their species, faerie linnorms are fiercely territorial and reclusive. Faerie linnorms select secluded and concealed locations for their lairs and outfit them in elaborate, but usually nonlethal, traps. A faerie linnorm may live at the heart of an ever-changing hedge maze, deep within a hall of mirrors, or within a cave covered in disorienting mushrooms. Whatever the case, faerie linnorm seek solitude in their day-to-day lives. For faerie linnorms, isolation is practical. First, in stark contrast to their more evil-natured cousins, faerie linnorms are frequently and actively sought out by fey and mortal alike who wish to have their fey agreements rescinded. This constant bombardment has led them to seek peace and quiet from their earnest petitioners.\n\nSecondly, unilaterally ending contracts is dangerous work, potentially earning the ire of a powerful fey who did not want the agreement to end before they received payment. For these reasons faerie linnorm do not frequently burn fey agreements, and if they do, they often require the consent of all parties to the deal … that is, if the parties can first find the faerie linnorm and quell its anger for disturbing its serene solitude.\n\n#### A Cursed Death\n\nThe dangerous nature of their occupation led some of the first faerie linnorm to seek repercussions for those who would kill them and discourage anyone from trying. In an ancient pact, the faerie linnorm sacrificed their ability to burn any deals made by Baba Yaga, who in return, placed a curse upon the blood of all Feywild dwelling linnorm: a creature that kills a faerie linnorm falls victim to a curse. The curse can vary from one faerie linnorm to another, but the most common is one that inhibits the killer's ability to make any more deals in their own favor.\n\n#### Adult Faerie Linnorm Death Curse\n\nWhen the linnorm dies, the creature that killed it must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. The cursed creature finds it exceedingly difficult to sway others with their words: whenever the creature makes a Charisma check with a DC greater than 10 as part of a social interaction, the creature has disadvantage on the check and additionally gains a level of exhaustion if they succeed on the check.\n\nThe linnorm's death curse can only be removed by the casting of a *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or a similar spell while standing inside of a circle formed of the dead linnorm's hoarded collection of treasures and gold worth at least 1,500 GP. The cursed creature must then succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw to remove the curse. If the curse is successfully removed in this way, the circle magically transforms into a faerie linnorm egg, which then vanishes to a random part of the Feywild. After three failed attempts, the curse's removal by ritual can't be attempted again for a year and a day. Alternatively, the linnorm's curse can be removed by the *wish* spell or by divine intervention without the need for the ritual.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":18,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":60,"speed":"20 ft., fly 80 ft.

While they can be found nearly anywhere on any plane where people dream, their iconography is most frequently found in **Kara-Tur**. According to Shou Lung legend, a person who wakes from a bad dream can call out to a baku three times for it to devour their nightmare. But calling for a baku must be done sparingly because, if it remains hungry after eating the nightmare, it may also devour the dreamer's hopes and desires, leaving behind a shell of a person. There is but only a little truth to this legend, for baku are creatures of good intent.\n\n#### Kwan Ying's Nightmare Eaters\nBaku serve their creator, Kwan Ying, the Sapphire Empress of Kara-Tur's Celestial Bureaucracy. Long ago, shortly after the beginning of humankind, Kwan Ying noticed that many of her followers were suffering in their sleep. Knowing that these bad dreams were destined to be consumed by **Dendar** if nothing was done to prevent them and wanting to end suffering, the Compassionate Kwan Ying traveled to the **Region of Dreams** and created the first baku from stray pieces of dream matter made real through her divine touch. She instructed the baku to travel the planes and ease the suffering of dreamers by devouring nightmares before Dendar could sink her fangs into them.\n\n#### Celestial Chimera\nWhile baku are spiritual beings that hail from the Region of Dreams, they have well-defined physical appearances. A baku is a **chimera**, typically having the body of a bear, trunk of an elephant, paws of a tiger, tail of an ox, and eyes of a rhinoceros. Beyond their chimeric composition, however, baku vary in appearance and coloration. Some baku have several sets of eyes or multiple tusks. And while tiger ears are most common, some baku have ox or elephant ears.\n\n#### Dreamscapers\nThe celestial dream eater doesn't just gain sustenance from nightmares and dreams, it can also mold them and change them on a whim. Baku usually use this ability to collect the nightmare energies and create a new dream for the sleeping mortal to enjoy while they eat. In addition, while within the Region of Dreams, a baku can take on the shape of any beast. These two abilities render the baku the ultimate dreamscaper.\n\n#### A Hunted Species\nCreatures that thrive on nightmares terrorizing sleeping mortals threaten the baku's existence. Centuries of being hunted by servants of Dendar, night hags, fech, and the like have led to the near extinction of the already rare baku. Today, these servants of Kwan Ying are less trusting of beings they don't know. Baku are likely to remain invisible or disguise themselves as a beast and watch the strangers for a while to determine whether or not they can be trusted. Only after a baku determines that a stranger is unlikely to do it harm will it openly approach them.\n\n#### Beings of Mercy\nBaku were created to help end and prevent suffering, not spread it. Ever hungry, they most frequently use their abilities to seek out and consume unpleasant dreams. When baku run into trouble, they prefer to flee or incapacitate their enemies. They only resort to lethal measures when there is no other means of escape or when a nearby dreaming mortal's life is threatened.\n\n**Note** Size can change (shapechanger)","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":15,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":10,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":40,"speed":"30 ft., fly 40 ft.

These specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.\n\n**Beyond Redemption**\nWhen a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits the Specter of Winters Past. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.\n\n**Undying Hatred**\nLiving creatures remind these specters that life is beyond their grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.\n\n**Winter Past**\nA Specter of Winters Past is a remnant of a humanoid that met its untimely end during winter and was prevented from passing on into the afterlife. It is doomed to haunt the place of its death during the winter months.\n\n#### Combat Tactics\n\nThe Specter of Winters Past would start combat with its Candle Extinguisher on its head, would use its Summon Spectral Helpers on its first turn of combat. On its second turn, it would remove its Candle Extinguisher from its head, hopefully after enemies have moved in to engage it, causing them to potentially be blinded. It would then try and use its Memory Twist ability, specifically to try and target as many enemies as possible so that its helpers can gang up on stunned targets. It will try and stay within melee range of its foes, using its Blinding Candle to its advantage as it pummels its enemies.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":14,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":42,"speed":"0 ft., fly 50 ft.

In doing so, they might be able to expand their influence over their undead armies and perhaps create something that posed more threat to their rivals and enemies.\n\nHowever, if you were to bring that story over to someone from the witch country of Rashemen, they would dismiss it for a story of their own.\n\n#### Primal Product of Witchcraft\n\nBarrow wyrms were originally created by the Rashmaar (or Rashemi) witch caste with the aid of both the willing souls of retiring members of their respective communities and the heart of an adult dragon. Originally, the barrow wyrms were created in response to the growing threat from the Thayan Plateau, as red wizards were getting closer and closer to the borders. To solve this problem, the original intention was to call upon the spirits of the past to help defend their people. However, there was a serious problem. Despite the witch caste's connection with the spirits, it became apparent that spirits who had long departed cannot be used for the upcoming process because they would not be able to agree to something they had no way of knowing about.\n\n#### One Last Hurrah\n\nCreating a barrow wyrm starts with a party of hunters that are sent off to hunt down an adult dragon, primarily due to its magic. Each of the hunters are aware that by the end of the hunt, they will be killed during the creation of the creature. So while a party of any age of capable dragon hunter would be allowed as long as they knew of the risks, the most preferrable would be a group of retiring patriotic veterans who would likely find it distasteful to die a mundane death. The hunt for the requisite dragon would be considered complete once the barrow, to which the wyrm will get its name, is made. After which, the newly created barrow wyrm will stand guard for many years.\n\n#### Territorial Sentinels\n\nA barrow wyrm's territory can easily get mistaken for the lair of an actual dragon, denoted by minor regional changes based on the dragon it was created from, and the stories of barrows themselves possibly containing buried treasure, which can be mistaken for its \"hoard\". Some barrow wyrms can be so old that they become overgrown and can be mistaken for a regular burial mound, a knot of thick tree roots, or a small marked cave. Once provoked, or once they detect an intruder, the barrow wyrm acts according to the whims of the spirits that were used to create it. They give up their assault once the intruder is far enough away from it territory.\n\nDepending on how they were made and who they were made from, barrow wyrms will either resort to violence upon first sight of an intruder in their territory or be willing to take\nsome time to study their new visitor while hidden away. Spirits generally can't learn of things that have happened past their death, so they tend to default to what they are used to\nand what they see in the moment.\n\n#### A Story Twisted\n\nIn the recent years since the Spellplague, certain practitioners of the arcane persuasion heard the stories surrounding the barrow wyrms and thought to replicate the process. However, given the resources that were needed to produce such a thing in the first place, these wizards decided to shorten the process using various necromantic arts and occasionally supplementing the heart of an adult dragon and souls of the willing with the souls of their enemies.\n\nThese \"lesser\" barrow wyrms were capable of serving their intended purposes as well as their original counterparts, but they lack the coherent ability to judge their surroundings properly. Another thing that lesser barrow wyrms lack is the draconic spark of magic that would normally allow them to alter their surroundings and use it to their advantage.\n\n#### Variant: Lesser Barrow Wyrm\n\nTo run a lesser barrow wyrm, lower the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of the barrow wyrm by 6 and lower its Wisdom and Charisma saving throw bonuses and its Perception bonus by 3 accordingly. A lesser barrow wyrm retains all other statistics. A lesser barrow wyrm does not have regional effects or lair actions.\n\n#### Variations\n\n- To determine a barrow wyrm's regional effect upon where it is located, use the regional effects for an adult dragon corresponding with what kind of dragon was used in the creation of the wyrm. The DC is the same as its lair actions.\n- If you want to run a lesser version of a barrow wyrm, forgo the regional effects, lower all mental stats by 6, and keep physical stats the same.\n- Depending on how they were made and who they were made from, barrow wyrms will either resort to violence upon first sight of an intruder in their territory or be willing to take some time to study their new visitor while hidden away. Spirits generally can't learn of things that have happened past their death, so they tend to default to what they are used to and what they see in the moment.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":19,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":11,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":55,"speed":"40 ft., burrow 30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 14, \"CON\": 20, \"DEX\": 10, \"INT\": 8, \"STR\": 22, \"WIS\": 12}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 6, \"CON\": 9, \"DEX\": 4, \"WIS\": 5}","skills":"Perception +9, Stealth +4","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Necrotic","damage_immunities":"Poison","senses":"Blindsight 60 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 19","languages":"Draconic and up to three other languages","cr":"11.000","legendary_header":"The barrow wyrm can take 3 legendary actions,\r\nchoosing from the options below.

For one minute, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling roots until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.\n- **Summon Spirits.** The spirits of the wyrm are called out in force: the barrow wyrm summons 4 (1d4+2) **sword wraith warriors** to unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the barrow wyrm that can take their turns immediately. The sword wraith warriors ignore difficult terrain created by the barrow wyrm and immediately disappear after taking their turns.\n- **Wall of Nature.** The barrow wyrm creates a wall of stone or plants on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5 and 30 hit points. If the wall is made from plants, it is vulnerable to fire damage, and if it is made of stone, it is vulnerable to thunder damage.

They don't care what they learn, so long as it is something new. This knowledge can range from inconsequential, such as a baker using month old flour to create their bread, to valuable like the secret password to open a magical door deep in an ancient temple. For a reason yet unknown, the maras are able to maintain a physical form outside of the Region of Dreams. Some believe it is fueled by their need for knowledge.\n\n**Psionic Potential**\nA mara acquires information through questions, riddles or when all else fails, through probing creatures thoughts for whatever it can find. The latter of which it prefers to do so by sitting on a creature's chest while it sleeps where its psionics are at its strongest, breaching through any mind as if the will has faded.\n\n**Odd Origins**\nIf the collective curiosity of an area is great enough while dreaming, then a mara is born. When coming into existence they know nothing, and though they don't need to eat they have a hunger inside them to be filled with information. A unique quirk about maras is that they can't understand each other. Therefore, they can't share anything amongst themselves leading to unusual behaviours when interacting with one another.\n\n**Silent Stalkers**\nIf a mara finds its way onto the Material Plane, it will wander aimlessly until it finds the closest town or settlement, slips into someone's home and usually cause distress in the process. Because of this, they are wrongly referred to as 'sleep paralysis demons', even though they aren't demonic in nature.\n\n**Curious Creatures**\nMaras are not hostile creatures despite their methods and appearances, striking up conversations with people, granted they don't attack them straight away. If someone tells a mara something they don't know, then they will repay that information in kind with something the donor doesn't. This usually leads to people knowing secrets they shouldn't.\n\n**Unusual Nature**\nThe mara doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":14,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":10,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":10,"speed":"40 ft., fly 40 ft.

The visage of a woman dressed in warm furs and a white gown upon her slender frame was standing just over a bridge. A white porcelain mask was the only thing seen of her face as the cold storm picks up around him, the sound of tearful weeping accompanies him as he succumbs to a biting cold.*\n\n\nWearing a decorated mask resembling their once-glowing faces, the Bitter Maiden is a mournful spirit whose feelings of melancholy have caused it to come back to the living world in order to try to fill the holes left in them in life. Whether or not that is physically or metaphorically is largely up to interpretation.\n\n**Inhabitor of a Former Visage**. A Bitter Maiden often takes the form of whoever they were before their eventual demise in life, albeit their body is in the state of death reminiscent of their final moments. Like their title suggests, a Bitter Maiden is most likely found around the place where they died, wearing a porcelain mask decorated in funerary offerings in order to hide the hideous truth beneath.\n\n**Predators in Winter**. Lonely souls that find themselves in the midst of a storm or traveling about on cold nights will also find themselves catching the eyes of the Bitter Maiden. Driven by a want of some kind of warmth in death, the maiden will approach these individuals and will eventually consume them after the initial kill. The Bitter Maiden's targets tend to be lone travelers, individuals who have recently experienced emotional loss, and orphans.\n\nIf a bitter maiden encounters another of its kind, their greedy nature will cause them to fight with one another over who gets claim over the prey before them.\n\n**Mask of the Dead**. The mask that the Bitter Maiden wears is merely to hide the hideousness of its undead nature. Though it might mimic the sounds and mannerism of the person it is supposed to be, the bitter maiden will not take off its mask nor allow anyone else to touch it. When the mask is removed, all that is left underneath is a feral malicious husk filled with decay.\n\nWhen its mask is removed, the bitter maiden can no longer keep up its guise and will fly into a rage to get it back, believing itself to not be undead. The bitter maiden under the mask is a pitiful creature of envy, greed, and emptiness. Some would even call it one of the evils of winter. It is attracted to sights of warmth and happiness, something it cannot have and will no longer be able to get.\n\n**Undead Nature**. A bitter maiden doesn't require air, food,\n\n#### Combat Tactics\n\n> Before combat, Bitter Maidens will never try to actively go after the party unless they pose a problem and put themselves between them and their target. They will watch and remain within eyeshot, especially with their Aura of Bitter Winter active around them until it is the perfect time to strike. In combat, the maiden will use their Bitter Hoarfrost on the first turn before using their bonus action to turn on their aura. They will then take advantage of their vision through the aura and move over to the back line to pick on anyone who looks most vulnerable and squishy with an Icy Glare then a Life Drain.\n>\n> **Toria's Advice**. Never actually use one of these to torture your players with loss unless you know the characters enough.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":16,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":48,"speed":"30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 16, \"CON\": 16, \"DEX\": 14, \"INT\": 10, \"STR\": 16, \"WIS\": 14}","saves":"{}","skills":"Deception +9, Perception +5","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Necrotic; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical attacks","damage_immunities":"Cold, Poison","senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 15","languages":"The languages it knew in life","cr":"8.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:16.18893+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:16.18893+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Poisoned"},{"row_id":"61ea622a-1baa-413b-b96e-4daef62f0768","monster_id":"25b2212e-4ff9-40a1-ae8b-9e684f139b7a","version":"1.0","slug":"infected-toad","name":"Infected Toad","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"8e1f8c13-1657-407c-9a24-f5ede29118a4","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Huge","species":"Beast","alignment":"Unaligned","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":14,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":36,"speed":"30 ft., swim 40 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 7, \"CON\": 17, \"DEX\": 13, \"INT\": 2, \"STR\": 21, \"WIS\": 10}","saves":"{}","skills":"Stealth +7","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":"Poison","senses":"Darkvision 30 ft., Passive Perception 10","languages":"None","cr":"8.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:25.422847+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:25.422847+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Poisoned"},{"row_id":"6377bfa9-33ed-4f4a-9782-418f8289fbee","monster_id":"bde06764-3886-4c6a-be6c-4767e8ef96cb","version":"1.0","slug":"hollow-soldier","name":"Hollow Soldier","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"ead9d423-93c6-4d1f-ad76-195dd4764e53","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Undead","alignment":"Neutral Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(chain shirt, shield)","hit_dice_num":9,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":18,"speed":"30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 5, \"CON\": 15, \"DEX\": 13, \"INT\": 6, \"STR\": 13, \"WIS\": 8}","saves":"{}","skills":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 9","languages":"Understands all languages it knew in life but can't speak","cr":"1.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:24.858955+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:24.858955+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Exhaustion"},{"row_id":"655fa7d2-eb19-4593-ae58-e6c0bbd17bec","monster_id":"6c75399d-5d28-44de-aecd-70f7c1321922","version":"1.0","slug":"animated-snowman","name":"Animated Snowman","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"850f28c4-a6e1-4c6b-8587-9d4d6a1d432e","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d7/1d/5f/d71d5f745b6cbf89efb11bc612b44dfd.jpg","image_credit":"Unknown (https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/476326098069095049/)","token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Construct","alignment":"Unaligned","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"### Origins\n\nThe original Animated Snowmen were built by a group of nomadic gnomes traveling on the High Ice to protect their settlement from marauding monsters.

Some have joyful and peaceful celebrations, while other creatures are up to something more... sinister.\n\nEvery Midwinter, a green hag named Grincheuse decorates spruce trees with beautiful ornaments before awakening them and sending them out to villages throughout the land to do her bidding.\n\nTheir beautiful garland and glass baubles are meant to attract those looking to collect fancy trinkets and serve to make the awakened midwinter trees more approachable. ''Looks can be deceiving'' has never been more true when speaking of these trees. Thanks to Grincheuse's magic, the awakened midwinter tree can use its strands of garland to restrain its prey and ensure its success in capturing it, then bringing it to its creator.\n\nThe bright light cast upon the star placed atop the tree allows the awakened midwinter trees to travel more easily in darker environments. Akin to their fancy decorations, the star serves as a lure to attract the curious passersby who would be tempted to inquire about the shining light in the distance.\n\nGrincheuse is said to use the trees to capture villagers, notably children, during the time of Midwinter, hence the name ''awakened midwinter tree''. Rumors say she does so out of pure cruelty and desire to ruin the villagers happiness. Winter being harsh and cold, it is displeasing to her some could find warmth and joy in their hearts during that time. Those are only speculations, for no one was ever known to return from her clutches.\n\n#### Combat Tactics\n\nThe main goal of the tree is to capture people and return them to their creator. It will:\n* Target the easiest prey to grapple and drag away and hit them with a garland attack twice.\n* If both attacks hit the tree use their engulf ability.\n* Once it has something captured it will attempt to flee home while attacking anything that is hostile towards it.\n* It will use its Winter Balls attack to try to aid its cause by spreading glass everywhere between it and its opponents making it more difficult to chase after it.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":7,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":14,"speed":"20 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 7, \"CON\": 15, \"DEX\": 14, \"INT\": 10, \"STR\": 19, \"WIS\": 10}","saves":"{}","skills":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":"Fire","damage_resistances":"Bludgeoning, Piercing","damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Passive Perception 10","languages":"One language known by its creator","cr":"6.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:15.240339+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 04:11:32.503481+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":null},{"row_id":"6f218547-4dca-4656-8230-d2ec957470da","monster_id":"6c9eb7da-4672-4575-b6be-15d00bb48b17","version":"1.0","slug":"conibrr","name":"Conibrr","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"38bdd325-f504-4264-9a81-f0ac843069fd","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Huge","species":"Plant","alignment":"Neutral Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"In the harsh, cold forests of northern Faerûn, occasionally, a coniferous tree will awaken. However, unlike typical treants -- flora blessed by the fey who act as guardians of the wild -- these trees are often awoken through the actions and presence of malevolent entities. Whether it be the machinations of a devil or demon, magical essence from nearby drow, or simply a fey creature of ill intent, the awakening of a conibrr usually results in something that cares far more for destruction than preservation.\n\n**Twisted Relatives**. A conibrr, much like a treant, is a tree given sapience. Specifically, it is a coniferous tree given sapience through the influence of dark powers. They spend most of their time rooted in the ground, giving the appearance of a normal tree, only uprooting to attack nearby creatures when it suits their mood. Unlike most treants, conibrrs lack eyes, mouths, or faces of any kind, and are unable to speak, hear, read, or write. They do understand the languages of those who awoke them, but the only way to communicate with them is via telepathy, which they do not possess naturally.\n\n**Contempt for Nature**. Conibrrs do not particularly care for the forest in which they awoke, or life in general, and will gladly attack nearby wildlife when given the chance. The area in the immediate vicintiy of a connibrr will usually be devoid of any animal life, as the animals nearby will quickly learn that approaching the area is unsafe. Loggers, hunters, and others who might face the brunt of a treant's wrath for their actions will typically not awaken a conibrr's ire, though if they get too close the conibrr will often attack them for sport anyway.\n\n**Self-preservation**. Conibrrs will not attack a creature they believe to be much stronger than them, except in self-defense. Instead, they will rely on their natural camouflage to keep themselves safe. Though they lack typical sight, they can sense nearby living things, as well as heat, and will flee the area if necessary to avoid burning down.\n\n**Solitary Flora**. It is rare for multiple conibrrs to awaken in the same area; when such a situation occurs, one conibrr will typically drive the other out, or one will leave of its own accord. Conibrrs encountered in the wild are thus typically found alone.\n\n**Acidic Sap**. The awakening of a conibrr causes its sap to turn into a caustic acid. A thin layer of this sap coats the conibrr, as well as its needles (which it can jettison from itself at will), making direct contact extremely dangerous. Damaging a conibrr often causes this sap to spew forth from the resulting gash, damaging the attacker in kind.\n\n**Photosynthetic Nature**. A conibrr does not need to breathe, but it must remain rooted for at least 12 hours a day in order to meet its required fluid uptake. It gets its energy via sunlight, and is not carnivorous; all destruction it unleashes is entirely for destruction's sake.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":72,"speed":"25 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 14, \"CON\": 23, \"DEX\": 5, \"INT\": 9, \"STR\": 21, \"WIS\": 10}","saves":"{}","skills":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":"Fire","damage_resistances":"acid, bludgeoning, piercing","damage_immunities":"cold","senses":"blindsight 60 ft.

Some say it came about due to the magic of a powerful magic item known as the *Wonderful Throne* said to have the ability to bestow weredragon lycanthropy, others argue it was due to longstanding efforts by the Cult of the Dragon, while others argue that the first weredragon was a fusion of a humanoid and dragon in a turbulent area of wild magic.\n\nUltimately, most modern weredragons are created by a bite from an infected individual.\n\n#### Often Confused\nIt was a common assumption that weredragons were song dragons, metallic dragons who choose to live as human women. This is not the case and has often been the cause of infection for whole adventuring parties. Others upon meeting a weredragon have mistaken them for the rare drow-dragons which is another inaccuracy that will often lead to death.\n\n#### Draconic Urges\nA weredragon often feels the impulses and inclinations of the kind of dragon their hybrid form is associated with, whether it be the vanity and arrogance of red dragons, the gregarious nature of brass dragons, or so forth. Whether or not a weredragon indulges or resists such urges is a decision each individual weredragon makes for themselves.\n\n#### Curse of Lycanthropy\nA humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A *remove curse* spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a *wish*.\n\nA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the draconic urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its draconic hybrid form that combines dragon and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the dragon within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as vivid dreams.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their draconic natures succumb to their draconic nature, taking on the characteristics and personality of their draconic form.\n\n#### Variant: Full Dragon Lycan\nSome weredragons have ascended beyond the basic hybrid form and can become full dragons instead. If you wish to run a weredragon as a Full Dragon Lycan, replace its Shapechanger trait with the one below. A weredragon with this variant trait who can assume the form of a young dragon of CR 10 or higher should be treated as the CR of that dragon when used in an encounter.\n\n**Shapechanger (Young Dragon).** The weredragon has an associated young dragon form and can use a bonus action to polymorph into that young dragon, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. When the weredragon assumes its young dragon form, its statistics and capabilities are replaced with the statistics of a young dragon corresponding to the weredragon's Draconic Form (for example, a young amethyst dragon if the associated kind of dragon is an amethyst dragon), except any class features or legendary actions of that form.\n\nIn its young dragon form, the weredragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, damage immunities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this trait. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\n#### Player Characters as Lycanthropes\nThe *Monster Manual* has rules for characters afflicted with lycanthropy. The following text applies to weredragon characters specifically.\n\n**Weredragon:** The character gains the weredragon's senses and a Strength of 20 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength, and the save DC for their Werebreath is equal to 8 + the lycanthrope's proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope's Constitution modifier.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[\"Shapechanger\"]","ac":13,"conditional_ac":"(studded leather) in humanoid form, 14 (natural armor)","hit_dice_num":14,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":56,"speed":"30 ft.

Not much is known of these huge creatures, and it is uncertain if it is because of their scarcity, or if it is because no one lives to talk about them.\n\n#### Winter Festival\nIt is said that Inukpasugjuits go out after the first blizzard of winter as part of a brutish festival celebrating Thrym and pillage the settlements of the area. During these times, they are believed to carry a massive bag in which they capture humanoids after petrifying them to use them as playthings and decorations in their icy caverns. It is the reason they are seen carrying great clubs instead of great axes for this festival—they do not want to slice their future belongings apart.\n\n*\"I saw it grab my brother and breathe what seemed like ice upon him. I saw my brother begin to freeze and stop moving. It then put him in a large bag on its back and carried him away. Against my better judgment, I followed it. It was such a massive creature, yet so fast. After hours of walking, it reached a cavern where it brought my brother. I was  exhausted. Once I saw it leave the cavern, I went to peek inside... and I saw him. My brother, petrified in ice, was placed around a large table where tea had been set. Many others that had suffered the same fate as my brother were also around the table. What seemed like a younger version of the creature that got my brother was having a tea party with them. I wanted to scream, but I knew I shouldn't. I just ran. I ran away. I'm a coward. If you ever see an Inukpasugjuik, run and hide as best as you can; your best chance of escape is to avoid being noticed in the first place. I think they can sense your fear.\"*  \n   — *Anyu Iqniq, villager*\n\n#### Combat Tactics\n\nWhen hunting for “friends” during Midwinter, the Inukpasugjuit carries a greatclub. Unless it considers itself to be in danger, the Inukpasugjuit will attempt to incapacitate rather than kill its target, getting more pleasure from petrifying its living victim forever in ice rather than ending its life. Its first step will be to get within reach of the target to hit it with its greatclub, attempting to knock its target out. Whether or not it is successful, it will attempt to grasp its target and use its freezing breath to turn it into ice. When the Inukpasugjuit has frozen one of its victims, it will carefully place this newfound friend into one of its massive bags and carefully bring it home. If the Inukpasugjuit is attacked from range and cannot reach the attacker, it'll throw nearby rocks or boulders. If there are none nearby, it may reluctantly grab one of its “friends” from its bag and throw it at its attacker before trying to close in on the distance and make this new target the replacement for its now broken “friend.”","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":15,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":60,"speed":"40 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 12, \"CON\": 21, \"DEX\": 9, \"INT\": 9, \"STR\": 23, \"WIS\": 10}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 4, \"CON\": 8, \"WIS\": 3}","skills":"Athletics +9, Perception +3","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":"Cold","senses":"Passive Perception 13","languages":"Giant","cr":"8.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:25.640932+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:25.640932+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":null},{"row_id":"8d9ebf15-c232-4d54-aa29-88fb16b3fc4c","monster_id":"b35e868c-87d1-48e1-90ad-ba73ba716786","version":"1.0","slug":"annum","name":"Annum","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"2f2a3dbb-5145-4ca6-9dba-5e4e91b008a0","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/bbb6ca82-46b9-4703-9611-23f28adacbce/d74weae-dfc3a8c9-2238-4b73-8ca7-eeb43af26fc7.png/v1/fill/w_894,h_894,q_70,strp/munna___nightmare_mist_by_stilith_d74weae-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9OTAwIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvYmJiNmNhODItNDZiOS00NzAzLTk2MTEtMjNmMjhhZGFjYmNlXC9kNzR3ZWFlLWRmYzNhOGM5LTIyMzgtNGI3My04Y2E3LWVlYjQzYWYyNmZjNy5wbmciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9OTAwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.2ISZqUthgQWGyOHcNcGXiPFiv_jvPQXQO7wlLJc0nGM","image_credit":"Stilith (https://www.deviantart.com/stilith)","token_url":null,"size":"Small","species":"Aberration","alignment":"Neutral","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"Annums are strange, floating aberrations spawned from the dreams of an eternally hungry beholder.

Not only are the creatures dangerous in the extreme, but the source of their many potent abilities is not readily apparent, even to the trained observer. Sages believe their erratic movement and elusive nature stems from some innate ability to manipulate time — hence, their name.*  \n— Stannis Alensin, Loremaster and Royal Archivist\n\nTemporal drakes are draconic creatures with snake-like elongated bodies, but also have expansive wings, a long tail, and large tearing claws at the ends of their four limbs. A temporal drake seems to blink in and out of sight at unpredictable intervals, their gray scales reflecting light in odd patterns. A typical temporal drake measures 5 feet tall from the shoulder, with an 18-foot wingspan and weighing 1,250 pounds.\n\n#### Temporal Predators\nSimilar to wyverns, temporal drakes are distant cousins of true dragons. While temporal dragons lack the intellect and size of true dragons, they prove dangerous foes nonetheless owing to their namesake ability to manipulate the flow of time.\n\nA temporal drake can step into and out of time, moving forward and backward in time or even into other times or out of time to a limited degree. While not capable of true time travel, a temporal drake shifts through time to appear as if teleporting while moving, to blink in and out of existence to avoid harm, to anticipate and react to the actions of others, and even to apparently resurrect itself from the dead. Temporal drakes can also shift other creatures out of time by temporarily trapping them in a suspended state separate from the normal time stream.\n\nDue to their ability to control time, some scholars theorize that temporal drakes draw their ancestry from the mighty and mythical time dragons of ages past. Regardless of the true nature of their origins, temporal drakes are deadly ambush predators, hunting animals and other creatures for food and for sport. Due to its physical prowess and innate capacity to control time, a temporal drake is supremely confident in its ability to assault even large groups of enemies, though it will flee when it finds it is overwhelmed.\n\n#### Trained Mounts\nMost temporal drakes are wild and untamed, but a temporal drake that is hatched or caught from a young age can be trained to act as a mount. Though intelligent beings, a temporal drake requires training to accept a rider, a process that is both costly and dangerous and that takes at least six weeks to complete. Simply acquiring a temporal drake egg itself costs at least 15,000 gp on the open market, with hatchlings fetching in excess of 35,000 gp and more. Additionally, few individuals have the experience and skill to train such creatures, and those that do charge at least 5,000 gp or more for such a service. Once properly trained however, temporal drakes make for highly sought after intelligent mounts given their mobility and powerful supernatural abilities.\n\n#### Tactics\n- Temporal drakes are usually encountered either as a solitary creature or as a pair of drakes. They can also be encountered as trained intelligent mounts of resourceful and powerful enemies, such as of a well-connected **archmage** or **warlord**.\n- Between its high speed, flight, Temporal Slide, and the flexibility afforded by Saw It Coming, a temporal drake can act as an effective skirmisher to dart in and out of the fray. It won't hesitate to wade into battle, but it will flee if it is outmatched.\n- A temporal drake fights as a cunning and dangerous ambush predator that prefers to surprise its prey. It can use Time Slip to improve its own Dexterity (Stealth) checks in this regard.\n- A temporal drake typically uses Time Slip in combat to improve a saving throw or to ensure it hits a key attack against a priority target. Between Time Slip and Progressive Initiative, a drake's initiative count will frequently change from round to round.\n- A temporal drake prioritizes anyone that looks like a spellcaster in combat. It can potentially interrupt spells being cast by using Saw It Coming to make an attack or using Temporal Inversion in response to a spell being cast within its vicinity.\n- The temporal drake's Bite removes a creature's ability to take reactions for a round, which can be used to prevent its foes from Readying their actions to attempt to counter Saw It Coming or to remove valuable reaction options from spellcasters.\n- Temporal Inversion is a powerful ability that a temporal drake freely uses whenever available if a creature is not already under its effect. The drake prioritizes non-spellcasters or other creatures the drake suspects are weak against Wisdom saving throws so it can focus on other priority targets.\n- Saw It Coming is a temporal drake's most versatile and flexible ability. At a minimum, the drake can use it to make an additional Bite attack each round, but it often prefers to use it defensively or to help grant it a key advantage. A drake can use it to move to a more advantageous position or to chase a fleeing enemy. A drake could also use it to avoid and negate attacks and spells targeted at it by moving out of range or behind total cover. A drake could also use it to Hide after making its attacks and moving behind cover.\n- The drake that appears due to Recurrence only exists and acts for one round and as such will focus on inflicting as much damage during that round as it can without regard for its survival or well-being.\n\n#### References\nDecker, Jesse. \"[Temporal Drake](https://web.archive.org/web/20161101074122/http:/archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20031122a).\" *Wizards of the Coast*, 22 November 2003.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":19,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":14,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":56,"speed":"60 ft., fly 60 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 16, \"CON\": 18, \"DEX\": 21, \"INT\": 8, \"STR\": 22, \"WIS\": 14}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 7, \"WIS\": 6}","skills":"Perception +10, Stealth +9","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 20","languages":"Draconic","cr":"11.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-04 15:38:05.640819+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:30.811406+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":null},{"row_id":"9a9d79c6-4673-426e-b0c5-84d739bfb917","monster_id":"04d6a81f-b256-4540-81fe-96359656b885","version":"1.0","slug":"the-nutcracker","name":"The Nutcracker","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"2246d05a-6cbe-4a41-9bcd-4c56b528674c","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Tiny","species":"Construct","alignment":"Chaotic Good (50%) or Chaotic Evil (50%)","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"The Nutcrackers are small constructs created by fey and are most often seen during the winter.

They are shaped like a dragon, but have gray fur instead of scales, and their wings are bat-like and leathery. Their foreclaws have opposable thumbs just like humans. They speak in light voices which makes them sound like a child. These inquisitive and talkative dragons love art and knowledge. Although they tend to be solitary in their travels, their curiosity leads them to interact with people.  However, this curiosity sometimes leads them into trouble. Their opposable thumbs allow them to use a special clay tablet and stylus that they use to make records, but each has a different idea has to what needs to be recorded. They typically\ndo not use any other tools. Kodragons have a high level of wanderlust. However, for some, when they get older, that desire to wander fades, and they will instead choose to maintain the secret repositories where kodragons leave their tablets. Other kodragons are sometimes employed as emissaries or agents to astral dragons given their eloquence and record keeping skills. \n\nKodragons give live birth to their children.They have a pouch on their abdomen where their infants are kept safe, which operates in a similar fashion as a bag of holding, being much bigger inside than it seems. Kodragons often use this pouch to hold their tablets and styluses.  Kodragons sustain themselves by drinking liquid of any kind.  \n\n#### Tactics\n\nKodragons tend to avoid combat whenever possible, but if forced to fight or defend themselves, they will stay aloft, allowing them to maneuver in the air, and fly by their enemies to claw and bite them, and then fly out of range. They can dart through the air and around their enemies very quickly, which makes them extremely hard to hit while in flight. Kodragons have two magical breath weapons, one that shrinks its target, and the other one brings them back to their initial size. However, the latter breath doesn't reverse other means of shrinking, but instead only reverses the effect of its shrinking breath. A kodragon will usually try to open the fight by shrinking their enemies before attacking them in melee. If they are in a dire situation, they will either teleport or plane shift away to survive.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":15,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":5,"hit_dice_size":4,"hp_modifier":5,"speed":"20 ft., fly 60 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 15, \"CON\": 13, \"DEX\": 20, \"INT\": 16, \"STR\": 4, \"WIS\": 12}","saves":"{}","skills":"Arcana +6, Investigation +6, Perception +5, Stealth +4","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Blindsight 10 ft., Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 15","languages":"Draconic, Common","cr":"2.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:26.296673+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 06:11:05.549946+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":""},{"row_id":"a65c5468-67c3-4f08-9e54-5510c9851199","monster_id":"6949b8c4-3afb-4ffb-b46b-2eabb557ec89","version":"1.0","slug":"drowned-soul","name":"Drowned Soul","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"a0e13f3b-b084-43ff-86ff-cc494be69288","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":"https://orig00.deviantart.net/0ee6/f/2014/356/3/9/infected_zombie_sth_by_noistromo-d8ar6z8.jpg","image_credit":"Noistromo","token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Undead","alignment":"Lawful Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":13,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":3,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":9,"speed":"20 ft., swim 30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 5, \"CON\": 16, \"DEX\": 6, \"INT\": 3, \"STR\": 13, \"WIS\": 6}","saves":"{\"WIS\": 0}","skills":null,"damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Fire","damage_immunities":"Poison","senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 8","languages":"Understands all languages it spoke in life but can't speak","cr":"0.250","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:21.380349+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:21.380349+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Poisoned"},{"row_id":"aac183c2-3e29-40cb-9122-8b993d01794c","monster_id":"0bd63e8f-31dc-40c0-b23f-6040ed8e63a9","version":"1.0","slug":"young-mercury-dragon","name":"Young Mercury Dragon","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"f819bd16-5cf4-43bc-8256-af2c4eb1c5af","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Large","species":"Dragon","alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","alignment_prefix":"typically","description":"Mercury dragons are whimsical creatures in both a physical sense and a mental one. They delight in being **unpredictable** and value **variety** above all else before moving onto the next thing that catches their attention.\n\n#### The Spice of Life\nMercury dragons are a type of dragon with silver metallic scales that closely lock together, almost indiscernible as such from a quick glance. They move quickly and with a notable agility that makes them hard to keep up with. In combat, they are known to favor **unpredictable tactics**, even those that may be considered to be cruel or dishonorable to any outside viewer. In contrast, the dragon sees its apparent cruelty as a way to learn more about the creature before them, their natural curiosity driving them to find out if the creature is more valuable alive or if the dragon in its stale boredom should even keep them alive.\n\n#### Mercurial Nature\nIronically, the mercury dragon's titular mercurial nature extends to its choice of lair. While typically living in **volcanic vents and tunnels**, they can also be found residing in glaciers, mountains, and even within the ever-changing **Elemental Chaos**. Mercury dragons are also known to **hoard all kinds of things** from a variety of types and sources. Their lairs can feature jewels and coins from all places, planes, and eras, as these dragons want to have at least one extra new thing to add to their collections.\n\nThis even extends to the food that they eat, which there is nothing they cannot, but they tend to prefer metallic ores. As such, a mercury dragon will strive to have something different everyday. If they do not, they end up feeling lethargic and listless due to lack of variety.\n\n#### Creatures of Capriciousness and Cunning\nOne of the favored places for a mercury dragon to reside in is a lair that is maintained by another creature, preferably one that can suit its need to have variety. In a sense, they can form business relations with mages, priests, rulers, and possibly more sinister entities. This mutual relationship does not mean that the other party can guarantee the dragon's loyalty. In fact, a mercury dragon is just as likely to simply go against an arrangement if the other party attempts to cheat it, bore it with a lack of variety, or the dragon just wants to do so \"just to see what happens.\"","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":18,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":15,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":45,"speed":"40 ft., fly 80 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 15, \"CON\": 17, \"DEX\": 16, \"INT\": 12, \"STR\": 18, \"WIS\": 13}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 5, \"CON\": 6, \"DEX\": 6, \"WIS\": 4}","skills":"Perception +7, Stealth +6","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":"Fire","senses":"Blindsight 30 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 17","languages":"Common, Draconic","cr":"8.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:33.473706+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:33.473706+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Blinded"},{"row_id":"ac39cfff-23a0-49d7-bb84-c996beeb4639","monster_id":"6e9fc369-b954-4ad5-ba00-ae31ac1d6731","version":"1.0","slug":"champion-of-torm","name":"Champion of Torm","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"32e141dc-fd0b-47ef-9ad9-93a61103076f","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Humanoid","alignment":"Lawful Good","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"Champions of Torm represent the military might behind the various orders that worship Torm.

A deadeye's soul is imbued into a corpse in the Material Plane by a powerful devil, and it is assigned a bounty to collect. This bounty is a mortal who has cheated the devil out of a contract, and who the devil seeks revenge against. The deadeye reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a deadeye's sockets burn with hellfire and flare brightly in the presence of its bounty. If the deadeye's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the devil imbues the soul into another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the deadeye uses as a vessel, its bounty always recognizes that the deadeye has been sent to slay it.\n\n**Like a Man Possessed**. A deadeye has six months, six days and six hours to slay its bounty, and it is armed with a six-chambered hellfire pistol that can send its bounty straight to the Nine Hells. When its bounty is killed, or if the deadeye fails to kill its bounty before its time runs out, the deadeye's soul returns to the devil that owns it. If the bounty is too powerful for a single deadeye to claim by itself, a devil often sends multiple deadeyes for the job.\n\n**Unholy Justice.** A deadeye is similar to a revenant, only that it doesn't come back once it is destroyed. A deadeye has to rely on its skill and its cunning to track down a bounty. Often, a deadeye is assigned more than one bounty, and the names are inscribed onto the pistol's cylinder. If the deadeye's body is destroyed, its soul returns to the devil, where it can plead for another chance to complete its task. If a deadeye is successful in negotiations, it can plead for its soul to be released in exchange for damning multiple souls of those that have cheated the devil.\n\n**Undead Nature**.

Myth and legend claim that rather than be summoned by the coming of winter, they are harbingers thereof, given leave by their Queen to savage the world with ice to remind the people of Faerûn to be grateful for the warmth and companionship of friends.\n\nStronger than their size gives them credit for, they entertain themselves by playing pranks and harassing travelers who have more bravery than sense to risk trekking out in the biting cold. A known menace to Faerûn, they appear as blue globes of light, pelting wanderers with storm of freezing snowballs and burying them in ice. Within the confines of a structure built with iron however, they appear as beautifully sculpted winged figurines made of ice. Prideful and vicious, they enjoy the terror and fear of mortals, but equally treasure veneration and supplication by those creatures. While forbidden from murder or maiming of mortals by the compact with the Queen of Air and Darkness that allows them free reign upon the material plane, Frost Fairies are allowed to defend themselves and kin with lethal retribution. As befits the capricious fey, this retribution might itself have been enabled by a victim's attempt to defend itself from the fairies' harassment.\n\nDefeating a frost fairy safely involves bribery, flattery, and submission. Offering the fairy gifts freely given with charming words can lead a Frost Fairy to leave its victims alone, though not without spiriting away its newly given tribute. In some cases, with a considerably generous gift, some Frost Fairies build an interest in a mortal beyond that of a victim, sometimes pledging themselves as a creature's ally or familiar. In these cases, the fairies practice a twisted sense of loyalty, upholding their companion's interests. But it's wise to remember that a Frost Fairy is never a slave, they act of their own volition, and take action to benefit their companion, sometimes in ways that are undesired.\n\nNevertheless, it is not without hope. A Frost Fairy's friendship or help can be courted with gifts and flattery, and are often valued for their magical talents as familiars by wizards and other spellcasters. However, it is wise to always remember that a fey does as it wishes, and the nature of relationship is never that of a master and minion.\n\n#### Combat Tactics\nFrost Fairies are beholden to the ancient compact that allows them to visit the material plane and wreak their havoc. While permitted to harass creatures, they're forbidden from mortal harm or permanent injury, though as expected from a fey the letter is followed if not the spirit. Frost Fairies are permitted to break this compact for the sole reason of defending themselves against harm, though the definition of harm can be as vague as the fairy intends it. Typically, this leads to Frost Fairies harassing or attacking their victims with vicious pranks. Pelting with frozen snowballs, causing them to slip, stealing belongings, all of it done to provoke a creature into defending itself so that that fairies may retaliate with force.\n\n#### Variant: Frost Fairy Familiar\nThe Fairy can enter into a compact to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing creature. While the fairy is within 10 feet of its bonded creature, the creature shares the fairy's cold immunity and fire resistance. The fairy can end its service as a familiar at any time on a whim, ending the telepathic bond.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":5,"hit_dice_size":4,"hp_modifier":15,"speed":"10 ft., fly 60 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 18, \"CON\": 16, \"DEX\": 18, \"INT\": 14, \"STR\": 15, \"WIS\": 8}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 6, \"DEX\": 6}","skills":"Acrobatics +6, Deception +6, Intimidation +6","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Fire","damage_immunities":"Cold, Poison, Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered","senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Blindsight 30 ft., Passive Perception 9","languages":"Common, Sylvan","cr":"4.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:22.937216+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:22.937216+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Paralyzed; Charmed (while in the Feywild)"},{"row_id":"c8fac7e8-c372-4fe2-b951-b34344ab70a8","monster_id":"8bfdfeb3-e967-4ba2-aa37-6185250e1f72","version":"1.0","slug":"dark-stalker","name":"Dark Stalker","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"d0fc0bb6-95a2-4403-b036-e8fa725de118","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Huge","species":"Monstrosity","alignment":"Neutral Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"The dark stalker is an evil being tending to stick to the shadows lying in wait for unsuspecting prey to walk by.

It is also likely to make full use of the environment to its advantage both before and during combat, hiding in the shadows via its Shadow Stealth or skittering out of sight with its Spider Climb.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":7,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":28,"speed":"40 ft., climb 40 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 12, \"CON\": 18, \"DEX\": 23, \"INT\": 13, \"STR\": 16, \"WIS\": 14}","saves":"{\"DEX\": 10, \"WIS\": 6}","skills":"Acrobatics +10, Intimidation +5, Perception +6, Stealth +14","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Necrotic; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical weapons","damage_immunities":"Poison","senses":"Darkvision 120 ft., Blindsight 30 ft., Passive Perception 16","languages":"Understands Undercommon but doesn't speak","cr":"9.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:20.442693+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:20.442693+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Charmed, Frightened, Poisoned"},{"row_id":"ceeadc78-5318-48ba-818b-1c2c0700852e","monster_id":"1bcbb48c-8370-482c-8652-0bcf18f0269a","version":"1.0","slug":"aether-dreamstalker","name":"Aether Dreamstalker","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"d63eca0e-474b-43e6-bfd2-49f3605a0a7c","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Monstrosity","alignment":"Unaligned","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"The Aether Dreamstalker is a predator that inhabits the Region of Dreams, using the fitful sleep of those in the Material Plane to manifest a corporeal form.

The city of Corsil, faced with destruction by ogres was converted by the last of its defenders into a vengeance dungeon. Locking themselves away behind the walls of their city, the citizens of Corsil became something else. Something wretched. A great evil laired in the sunken ruins of Corsil: Skinner. The guardian, ruler, and keeper of Skinner's Tomb, once the magnificent city of Corsil wanders the halls of its prison and crypt, ever seeking more flesh to add to its body, as under its rule, the dead of Corsil maintain their lasting vigil.\n\n> ***\"Skinner, Skinner!

He’ll pluck out your eyeballs and devour your kin! Skinner, Skinner! Run while you can! Your flesh will be taken with a touch of his hand! Hide in the darkness, hide in the light. Fighting is useless; Skinner is fright. He takes our hides and hides our bones And makes this place our very last home. Skinner, Skinner, never open his door. Or soon your bones will lie on this floor.\"*\n\n#### Ruined Domains\nSkinners or Fleshworms prefer to reside within crypts or ruins, seeking out flesh, flaying it from the living to add it to their distended bodies. As wretched as they are physically, Skinners wrong the world itself with their very existence. The tortured existence and method of their collection acts as a beacon for negative energy. The misery and horror they leave in their wake, along with the corpses act as a channel for negative energy to corrupt the very plane around where they reside.\n\n#### Barrow Lord\nOccupying the decaying bones of civilization, a Skinner has a handy supply of the dead. Its presence encourages and draws negative energy to gather, animating the dead. As the undead rise, a Skinner can enforce its will upon it, creating a loyal force of the deathless to obey it and defend the location of its residence. A Skinner is not selective with the undead that rise in its wake, however it does not tolerate the presence of competing greater undead. When not distracted with allure of fresh skin, a Skinner carefully culls its flock of undead of any that might oppose it.\n\n#### Flayed Flesh\nA Skinner can tear the flesh from a creature with a single touch, adding it to their body as a compulsive collection, and protection. The true body of a Skinner is layered beneath sheet after sheet of peeled and stripped skin, carefully stretched over its form. The skin remains fresh and supple, but without feeling. A Skinner is at risk from acid, which would quickly consume through the various layers of flesh lining its body.\n\n#### Bloated Bodies\nA Skinner's form has the appearance of a massive bloated slug-like body that reared upright.  It is layered and congealed, in dead skin and flesh that ripples and twists. It is yellowed in places, fleshy pink in others, sometimes flecked with blood, but mainly white. The skin carries the general features of the recent victims, making the imprints of their empty and vacant faces that appear on a Skinner's body. A Skinner has no head truly, but rather a sunken face lacking a nose, ears, or hair. Its eyes are sunken sockets filled with a crimson mouth and is mouth a gaping, empty void. A Skinner does not have legs, but it has two massive arms, with hands wide enough to curl around most humanoids, with long, almost delicate fingers of slick white flesh. Exposed along the palms, raw, red flesh can be seen underneath.\n\n#### Maddened Minds\nWhen a Skinner adds flesh to its body, rumor has it that it steals a figment of the victim's mind. Survivors claim that simply being near a Skinner, they could hear the voices of their friends and other victims of the Skinner whispering, echoing in their minds, begging them to join them, whispering of all twisted wants that the Skinner has, a chorus of maddened voices. Despite this however, a Skinner is quite lucid and aware, acting more as a general or commander for the rest of its lair's guardians.\n\n#### Paralyzing Fear\nLegend has it that a Skinner's gaze can turn blood to ice and minds to rot. While legends grow with telling, there is truth to the power of a Skinner's gaze. To be seen by it is to unlock some primal animal fear. Those without the will to resist find themselves frozen with fright, unable to move or resist as Skinner slowly crawls its way toward them, reaching out with one raw, red palm for a single, last caress. Despite this however, the true skin of a Skinner is sought after by many artificers, being a vital component for frightening effects, such as wands of fear or maces of terror.\n\n#### Tactics\nA Skinner is an intelligent creature, picking its battles carefully and preparing the battlefield to its benefit. It acts as a commander and leader to the forces of undead that it keeps in its thrall. A Skinner in its lair is almost always encountered with its undead minions to assist and protect it.\n\nA Skinner will make use of its Gaze of Fear, isolating those most vulnerable to its terrifying gaze, and relieving them of their skin with its Flensing Touch. Skinners, when given the option, are focused entirely on adding to its collection of skin. Once a creature has been relieved of it, it prefers to move on to the next victim. However, if a victim is particularly resilient, returning to the fight to combat the Skinner once more, the Skinner has no qualms with killing the creature once and for all.\n\nAs rulers of a domain, Skinners are territorial. A Skinner will clearly demarcate a boundary to itself as the range of its rule. While easily provoked with the temptation of fresh skin to add to its body, a Skinner typically will remain in the bounds of its lair, rarely preferring to roam.\n\nWhen faced with either acid or with its barrier defeated, a Skinner will prefer to flee, ordering the undead under its control to overwhelm its pursuers and buy it time to escape to safety where it may isolate a target, and quickly begin rebuilding the coating of flesh around its form.\n\nWhen facing creatures immune to the paralyzing effect of its frightening gaze, a Skinner will prefer to crush the creature into unconsciousness before relieving the victim of its skin through the use of its Flensing Touch.\n\n> \"Flesh so fine, so fine to tear, to gnash the skin; skin to strip, to plait, so nice to plait the strips, so nice, so red the drops that fall; blood so red, so red, so sweet; sweet screams, pretty screams, singing screams, scream your song, sing your screams...\"\n> -The ramblings of the sole survivor of an adventuring party encountering a Skinner unprepared.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":12,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":8,"hit_dice_size":12,"hp_modifier":40,"speed":"20 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 20, \"CON\": 20, \"DEX\": 7, \"INT\": 14, \"STR\": 21, \"WIS\": 15}","saves":"{\"CON\": 9, \"STR\": 9, \"WIS\": 6}","skills":"Intimidation +9","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Necrotic","damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Blindsight 120 ft., Passive Perception 12","languages":"Common, Telepathy 120 ft.","cr":"10.000","legendary_header":"The creature can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

These creatures haunt specific creatures, items, or locations, locked nearby until their final wish can be fulfilled.\n\nBut in a world of magic and realms, sometimes otherworldly beings can slip through. An object carried by the wrong person at the wrong time, an entire town translocated across time and space, or, in the case of Bouncy Ghost, perhaps it was simply that poor caravan driver, with his pale skin, and constantly illness, that brought it in.\n\nThe Bouncy Ghost is a creature driven of pure necessity. Unlike other ghosts, who seek to perform a task or desire before passing on, the Bouncy Ghost's only task is to not pass on at all. It is forever driven by a singular instictive desire; to return to a better life than it had when it died.\n\nSuch a desire, of course, is almost always unfulfillable. An adventurer cannot simply slay a beast, or solve the ghosts murder to release the Bouncy Ghost, as the Bouncy Ghost demands nothing but life itself. One cannot revive the original corpse of the Bouncy Ghost, because it does not desire to return to the wretched state from which it passed on.\n\nSo it is with this, the Bouncy Ghost forces itself into the unwilling bodies of those it can. But, its success is always short lived, for the pure malevolent energies of the Bouncy Ghost's eternal selfish ego begins to break down the unfortunate victim almost immediately. The victim finds itself trapped in their own body, aware that their words and actions are no longer their own. Their tongue twisting lies and deceit to ward off clerics and healers seeking to resolve the malady that has beset the poor victim. With this awareness, comes another realization: pain.\n\nThe victim possessed by the Bouncy Ghost is fully aware that their body is beginning to reject the invader. Skin becomes loose and peels off, teeth rot and fall out, hair dries and twists until it becomes nothing more than dust. Quickly, the body's rejection causes the organs to fail, as the ghost is expelled from the now deceased host, and quickly seeks to find another to give it another brief taste of the life it so demands.\n\nIt is in this manner that the Bouncy Ghost is named. Forever bouncing between hosts, struggling against its very self to find one powerful enough to survive its possession, yet forever failing. Unlike normal ghosts, there is slim chance of success to be found for the Bouncy Ghost. It will forever seek life, but bring only death.\n\n**Undead Nature**. A bouncy ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n#### Note\nA Bouncy Ghost is likely to be found in an adventure already possessing another creature, possibly insinuating itself among the party under false pretenses as a friendly NPC given its high Deception score. Such a ruse however is likely to be short-lived given the Bouncy Ghost's Body Rejection trait, and it will seek out other creatures, such as those of the adventuring party, to attempt to possess once its current body expires. Given its capacity to rapidly swap between bodies if needed with its Bounce Around, a Bouncy Ghost can present a deceptively deadly challenge to an adventuring party.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":14,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":16,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":32,"speed":"0 ft., fly 40 ft.

Although they were once a force of good on the Prime Material Plane, other elves came to fear them. Whenever a great force of evil threatened the lands of the Prime, they would hunt it down and annihilate it before returning to the Feywild.  \n\nHowever, the Master Hunter’s growing ambition and thirst for power corrupted them. Their behavior changed, and they began to threaten the balance between the Prime Material Plane and the Feywild. In response, a group of fey gathered allies and performed rituals to banish the Wild Hunt to the Far Realm. There, the members were warped and corrupted, embracing the madness. The Master Hunter, now known as the Spectral King, became the herald of one of the most destructive forces on Toril.  \n\n#### Fueled by Souls\nThe warriors of the Wild Hunt became juggernauts not only through Far Realm corruption but through their profane consumption of souls.

They are the twisted reflection of the druids they once were. Where once they represented nature and growth, yee naaldlooshii are the embodiment of corruption and unnatural decay. They perform perverse ceremonies and manipulate natural magic in opposition to the good, natural works druids traditionally perform, using their powers for evil by taking the form of animals to inflict pain and suffering on others.\n\nYee Naaldlooshiii are clever and use a variety of methods to lure unsuspecting victims to their death. They may pretend to be an animal snared in a trap or mimic the voice of a young woman crying out for help, only to ambush their rescuer. Occasionally they steal the faces of others, taking on the identity of a common traveler or even a member of an adventuring party traversing through their territory. These mimicries fool many, but a sharp eye and keen ear will recognize them as imitations.\n\nThough the Yee Naaldlooshii is capable of taking on any number of beast or hybrid forms, its true form is that of their previous humanoid appearance, albeit twisted and corrupted by the abominable acts of evil they have committed.\n\nYee Naaldlooshii are unsettling and dreadful creatures that often carry with them the stench of death. Some yee naaldlooshii’s humanoid and beast forms may be slightly unnerving. They may appear sickly or have an awkward gait. Others are more adept at blending in and infiltrate society. A friendly old neighbor lady, whose flowers are always blighted and wilted, may be a yee naaldlooshii in a cleverly crafted disguise, using her unassuming appearance to lure her marks. Thus, from ancient forests where they can hide among flora and fauna to sprawling cities filled with dark and deserted alleys, Yee Naaldlooshii are everywhere, waiting for their next victim.\n\nThe Yee Naaldlooshii are skilled and relentless hunters, creatures of legend that are spoken of in hushed whispers and fear. Yee Naaldlooshi are beings of abject evil, delighting in the terror they can induce in others and the torments they can visit upon their victims thanks to the wide array of abilities and skills at their disposal. Yee Naaldlooshi can be nearly impossible to truly spot until it's too late, using their skills in Stealth and the pass without trace spell to remain hidden as they wish or simply pretending to be something or someone else with their ability to Shapechange and Mimicry, as well as their high Deception score. They are likely to surprise the adventuring party when they can in a frenzy of attacks or with the use of the blight or erupting earth spell, before using their Shapechange or the entangle, fog cloud, or meld into stone spells to slip away before it can be truly caught or damaged. Even when encountered face to face, they prove difficult to truly put down thanks to their powerful defensive statistics.\n\nA Yee Naaldlooshi enjoys controlling others and manipulating them to its own ends, using its Charm to devastating effect to sow chaos among the ranks of the party and add thralls under its command.

Such monsters are likely to be the centerpiece monster of any adventure involving them, their presence felt throughout.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":17,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":14,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":56,"speed":"30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 18, \"CON\": 18, \"DEX\": 12, \"INT\": 10, \"STR\": 18, \"WIS\": 18}","saves":"{\"CHA\": 8, \"INT\": 4, \"STR\": 8, \"WIS\": 8}","skills":"Deception +8, Stealth +9","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":"Damage from spells; Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from nonmagical attacks","damage_immunities":"Poison","senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 14","languages":"Common, Druidic, Telepathy 60 ft.","cr":"10.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:32.841047+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:32.841047+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Poisoned"},{"row_id":"e990c608-9441-401c-bbc6-bb417f6bb1db","monster_id":"fa840ab8-52d1-4fe1-b5a6-7729ffd56455","version":"1.0","slug":"phantasmorca","name":"Phantasmorca","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"b00e6731-1230-4900-b2d6-82741dc07343","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":null,"image_credit":null,"token_url":null,"size":"Gargantuan","species":"Monstrosity","alignment":"Neutral Good","alignment_prefix":"typically","description":"***\"They say that there are many wonders that goes through the mind when one is in the midst of a well rested slumber.  Through the most pleasant of dreams and most sinister of nightmares, they say that you can hear a certain song calling out for you. Whether you consider this a blessing or an omen is not something you need to do in hindsight. Seeing is believing. Dreaming is in the imagination.\"***\n\nWandering in the Astral Plane, travellers sometimes encounter a phenomenon where they could see small pockets of space distorting in various places around them. Assuming it might be a normal occurrence in the plane, the travellers think nothing of it and move on. However, little do the foolhardy travellers know, the distortion continues to move closer and closer to them, but it is not giving chase as some sort of predatory creature. Rather, they are in the direct feeding path of a creature large enough to swallow them whole, a creature that they thought they would've seen coming from a mile away.  Sailing through the Astral Plane, a phantasmorca\nresembles an adult humpback whale with glowing fronds and patches on its body. It travels through the plane seemingly in a permanent trance and acts similar to a whale in its demeanor and behavioral patterns. However, most travellers to the Astral Plane are unable to see it for what it is until they are close enough to collide with it or get swallowed up by its massive maw. Unfortunately, the ships who come across a phantasmorca on the Astral Sea usually leads to them being shoved off course simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\n**Distorted Presence**. In the Astral Plane, a phantasmorca's body cannot be seen by the naked eye as some kind of force is bending around it in order to shield it from potential threats. Keen eyed individuals would see the phantasmorca's strange visual distortion as a ripple in the Astral Plane that would occasionally grow or shrink. However, when a creature approaches the phantamorca during an investigation, they will see its true form by way of approaching it from behind or when they are about to be swallowed by it.\n\n**Maw to Nowhere**. Looking into the maw of a phantasmorca will reveal nothing but a black hole to where no light could illuminate. This has puzzled many sages over the years as to what can be found inside or how a phantasmorca could gain sustenance to sustain its massive body.  However, taking in some eyewitness accounts from certain individuals that have appeared from beyond, it is said that the maw of a phantamorca is not a cold desolate hole in which hope is lost. In fact, they even say that on the other side, there exists a place where dreams were made real. Rather, they found themselves in the dream of those they knew and those\nthey did not. \n\n**Paradoxical Existence in a Realm of Dreams.**  Phantasmorca are creatures that originate from within the Region of Dreams and are born when a dreamscape becomes powerful enough to be more than a little short session. When dreams begin to connect and become continuous, a phantasmorca is born and made manifest, resembling an infantile whale calf. While a phantasmorca normally resembles a humpback whale or any other type of baleen whale, an extremely rare variant of the phantasmorca is born as the result of a nightmare going under the same transformation. These nightmare phantasmorca are more aggressive and resemble toothed whales. The phantasmorca resides within the Region of Dreams, but can project itself in the Astral Sea, when it happens, the phantasmorca will exist at the same time both in the Astral Plane and in the Region of Dreams. It appears as an adult within the Astral Plane and as a calf in the Region of Dreams.\nVery few individuals are sure on how long they live, but many can agree that the number of phantasmorca are equal to the amount of closely connected dreams that are created. If a phantasmorca is slain in the Astral Plane, its counterpart in the Region of Dreams also dies. If a phantasmorca is slain in the Region of Dreams, it will reform within 30 days as long as its counterpart in the Astral Plane is still alive.\n\n**Prized Commodity**. Due to their generally docile nature and rare appearance, phantasmorca are often hunted down for a variety of parts and are a subject of study. Inquisitive scholars are still finding out more things about the phantasmorca while collectors would be willing to pay mountains of gold for one of its baleen combs.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":16,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":13,"hit_dice_size":20,"hp_modifier":65,"speed":"0 ft., fly 80 ft.

They enjoy whittling down their prey before they strike, trailing victims for days, even weeks, while plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather.\n\n**Uncaring Spirits**. Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual cannibalism. They mark a wendigo’s territory with fetishes and dress in the furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take little interest in the practices of their worshippers, and view them only as an ample supply of victims.\n\n**Opportunistic Hunters**. The warmth of a campfire and shelter from the cutting wind are little protection against some of the things that lurk in the dark, isolated places of the world, where sustenance is scarce and hospitality nonexistent. High passes, forlorn tundra, trackless primeval woodlands, it is within these desolate places that one is most likely to encounter a wendigo: an evil spirit that preys on explorers and hunters when resources are running low and true desperation is setting in.\n\nWhile the flesh-eating beasts of nature might simply assault unwary victims head-on, the wendigo is a horror that turns the hunter into the hunted, plaguing its prey with bone-chilling nightmares at night and hazy visions of cannibalism during the day. The horrid images brought on by a wendigo’s curse cause the victim to slowly lose its grasp on what is right and wrong, ultimately inspiring the cursed individual to succumb to its terrible hunger pangs and feast upon its own allies in a gory act of shameful cannibalism.\n\n**Mythological Creatures**. Wendigos are little known outside the myths of certain indigenous tribes of particularly isolated regions, far from the security and hospitality of cities. The lands of the wendigo are where folk struggle to survive on a daily basis with already meager supplies stretched thin, where a single turn of bad luck can mean the difference between survival and starvation. It is under these circumstances, when fortune has turned against a lone hunter, isolated homestead, or lost wagon train, that wendigo psychosis, the insanity-inducing curse that forces innocents to indulge in the basest acts in order to survive, most often rears its vile head and draws otherwise normal people into acts of horrific desperation in which they must feed upon their own kind in order to survive.\n\n**Cannibalistic Urges**. The cannibalistic act brought on by wendigo psychosis is the last stage of the curse, at which point the victim flees straight into the sky at an unearthly speed, its legs burning away into jagged stubs, and becomes fully inhabited by a wendigo spirit, the body now only a shell for the hungry beast. A wendigo’s curse is not the only means of this transformation, however, as in some cases individuals who dwell in highly civilized lands but still partake in eating their own kind’s flesh also find themselves making the metamorphosis into wendigos. In societies where cannibalism is not seen as a taboo, individuals rarely if ever become wendigos, and these cultures generally have no history of encounters with such monsters. Scholars speculate that wendigo spirits require the perpetrators of the cannibalistic acts to be as shocked and shamed by their own actions as their victims are.\n\n**Unearthly Horrors**. While wendigos are widely believed to come from somewhere outside the Material Plane, none can say where exactly these horrors originate. Their unworldly powers and animalistic appearances inspire some to believe that wendigos are actually fallen agathions from the Beastlands; such claims are quickly dismissed by scholars, though they themselves can offer only a few alternative origin theories.\n\nMost regard wendigos as spirits from the darkest reaches of the multiverse, much like devourers and other monsters of mysterious purpose. What appearance these disembodied spirits may possess while within this nether region is a mystery to most, as no one has ever documented seeing a wendigo spirit not already residing in a material host. Because of this elusiveness, many folk on the outskirts of civilization regard wendigos simply as manifestations of mortal corruption, disembodied ideas rather than actual creatures.\n\n**Possessive Spirit**. A wendigo spirit only possesses a living host after the creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis. This curse is typically brought about by another wendigo who has touched a victim’s dreams or has dragged the creature into the sky with it. Occasionally, a particularly unlucky individual may contract wendigo psychosis simply through unfortunate circumstance, when it must perform gruesome acts of cannibalism in order to survive. When a creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis, the spirit of a wendigo is attracted to the creature to await its final act of desperation: devouring the flesh of one of its own kind, usually a close friend or loved one.\n\nOnce the victim falls to this level of madness, it makes its aerial sojourn through the sky, during which time its feet are burnt away into charred stumps from the speed of its passage, and the victim undergoes the full transformation into a wendigo; the original victim ceases to exist, its body mutilated and its soul sent to the afterlife, and the wendigo spirit inherits the body as a new husk with which it can interact with the material world.\n\n**Gruesome Transformation**. A victim who dies of wendigo psychosis can only be brought back to life with powerful restorative spells such as true resurrection or wish. Bringing a victim back to life in this way may restore the original creature, but the wendigo who exploited the psychotic individual yet remains in its weathered shell, which is only a pale reflection of the mortal body it once was.\n\nWhen a wendigo assumes the body of a mortal, it warps the tattered corpse into an imagined representative of its own twisted desires and horrid imaginings. The hands turn into bloodstained claws, the flesh grows a layer of matted fur, and the head transforms into that of a grotesque, rabid animal, typically a wild creature native to the area where the mortal died. Thus a wendigo only barely resembles the original mortal creature whose body it now inhabits, the beast having shed all of its personal relics and clothing in exchange for its feral, nightmarish visage.\n\n**Territorial Stalker**. Once a wendigo has manifested in physical form, it begins to stalk all who enter its territory, either consuming its prey to sate its own endless appetite or inflicting its transformative psychosis upon victims to spawn more of its kind. While wendigo spirits are definitely not of this world, in their material forms they are native to the Material Plane and thus must eat in order to survive.\n\nWhen intelligent prey is scarce, a wendigo will indulge in its bestial desires and hunt weaker animals to feed upon. A wendigo is constantly wracked with intense hunger pangs, manifestations of its ravenous greed that are only temporarily relieved by feasting on such creatures that know fear. It is for this reason that wendigos prefer to feed upon humanoids, magical beasts, and any other creatures that know to be afraid of the dark and shudder at the sound of howling winds.","additional_info":"#### Customizable Traits\n\nYou can customize a wendigo by giving it one or more of the following traits.\n\n* **Corner of the Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. As a bonus action, the wendigo chooses a creature it can see to stalk. While wind walking within 120 feet of the target, it always seems to lurk just at the corner of the target’s field of vision. The target has disadvantage on all Wisdom checks as long as the wendigo stalks it. The wendigo can only stalk one creature at a time.\n\n* **Maddening Whispers (1/Day)**. As a bonus action while wind walking, the wendigo whispers maddening thoughts at one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. Only the target can hear the insane whispers and invitations of the wendigo. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the wendigo’s spell save DC or its Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction to an ability score lasts until it is removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n\n* **Mimicry**. The wendigo can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. The wendigo must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the wendigo’s Charisma (Deception) check.\n\n#### Tactics\n\nWendigos are powerful creatures that should inspire terror in characters throughout their entire adventuring careers. They must be played as mysterious and horrid creatures to make them terrifying encounters.\n\n* A wendigo hunts over a wide region, even beyond its lair. The myths surrounding the wendigo in the area are usually only told in whispers, and commoners’ inordinate fears of such creatures can create great foreshadowing opportunities.\n* A wendigo stalks prey for days. It haunts the dreams of the weak willed, whispers temptations of betrayal using telepathy, lures away creatures from their group using deception, and it strikes when it knows it has the advantage.\n* In combat, a wendigo makes use of its speed to strike and swiftly fly out of sight, recovering from any wounds in mere moments. It takes advantage of its blindsight to strike when visibility is low, and howling when groups of prey are close together. In its lair, a wendigo uses tunnels or crevices to retreat and hide.\n* A wendigo attempts to use its wind walk on any grappled creature, stranding the victim in some rural area, usually miles from where it began.\n* A wendigo despises fire and retreats from any source that threatens it. In its lair, the wendigo tries to dispose of any sources of fire first.","tags":"[]","ac":18,"conditional_ac":"(natural armor)","hit_dice_num":12,"hit_dice_size":10,"hp_modifier":36,"speed":"0 ft., fly 120 ft.

Some manage to keep a sliver of their original self, though with a fractured mind. If they somehow manage to survive the unforgiving lands and find a way back to the Material Plane, they are changed both physically and mentally. All aspects of their old personality are lost, creating a void they wish to fill through whatever means necessary.\n\nDue to **Slashers** clinging onto their old memories as best they can, they first try to return home to regain some normalcy. After some time, they get unnerved by the small details of their life and find their family can no longer be found. They then move onto the next town, hoping to fill the nothingness that can't be filled.\n\n#### A Slasher's Lair\nWhen a slasher takes residence in any building for at least an hour, be it a castle, a storehouse or a tavern, it becomes the slasher's lair. When fighting in its lair the slasher can invoke its ability to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the slasher can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects. It can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The floors within the lair becomes unnaturally resonant. Until a different lair action is used, creatures walking within the lair have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.\n- The slasher chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until a different lair action is used, any number of doors and windows it can see open or close as it wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (needing a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until the slasher chooses to end the effect, or until the slasher uses this lair action again.\n- The slasher chooses a corridor or room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. All candles, torches or other open non-magical light sources are extinguished.\n\n#### Note\nA slasher in its lair uses its high mobility and stealth to move freely throughout its lair, supplemented with its Shadow Stealth, Wardrobe Stride, and Lair Actions. It will seek to ambush its victims, such as using its Knife to grapple members of a split party, attacking and slaying its victim without giving them so much as a chance to scream for help.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":15,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":13,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":39,"speed":"30 ft.","init_prof":"None","ability_scores":"{\"CHA\": 11, \"CON\": 16, \"DEX\": 15, \"INT\": 7, \"STR\": 18, \"WIS\": 12}","saves":"{\"CON\": 6, \"STR\": 7}","skills":"Athletics +7, Acrobatics +5, Deception +6, Perception +4, Stealth +8, Survival +4","damage_vulnerabilities":null,"damage_resistances":null,"damage_immunities":null,"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 14","languages":"Any two languages","cr":"5.000","legendary_header":"","lair_header":null,"regional_header":null,"created_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:29.194601+00","updated_at":"2026-01-06 01:52:29.194601+00","submitted_at":null,"archived_at":null,"condition_immunities":"Charmed, Frightened"},{"row_id":"fa8278e0-17d8-4205-b8d2-ba3a9d804624","monster_id":"24f8e02a-068e-4515-9a23-d0aa0e093596","version":"1.0","slug":"cauchemar","name":"Cauchemar","is_live":true,"status":"Approved","usage":"2014 Fair Game","creator_id":"44e32f43-d25f-4f7d-af6c-75e7eb1b1f7d","creator_notes":null,"reviewer_id":null,"image_url":"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/671/213/large/petar-milivojevic-nightmare.jpg","image_credit":"Petar Milivojevic / Hawthorne Dream Mash 2021","token_url":null,"size":"Medium","species":"Aberration","alignment":"Chaotic Evil","alignment_prefix":null,"description":"Nothing lasts forever, and the formations that arise in the Region of Dreams are especially ephemeral. When a desert can change to an ocean as quick as a thought, one could almost abandon the concept of permanence altogether.\n\nNevertheless, when a dreamscape discorporates into undifferentiated dream-stuff, it is possible for a small part to coagulate together into something more resilient and stable. Of course, without any external stimulus, even these forms are prone to breaking apart at a moment's notice.\n\nOccasionally, however, a denizen of the Region of Dreams will gather together a curated selection of these dream-stuff fragments. By combining solidified parts chosen from dreams (or dreamers) sharing similar qualities, it is possible to create something greater than the sum of its parts: a sapient consciousness consisting entirely of dream-stuff.\n\n#### Living Nightmares\n\nA **cauchemar** is a creature composed of dream-stuff harvested from the dreams of the hateful, the selfish, and the cruel. Typically, it is created with the intent of using it as a servant or something akin to a pet; this goal rarely comes to fruition, as a cauchemar is an intelligent creature, and resents being beholden to another's orders.\n\nLeft to its own devices, a cauchemar wanders the Region of Dreams, searching for unsuspecting dreamers to terrorize. Luckily for the dreamers in question, this behaviour has no ramifications for a physical body, so long as the cauchemar stays within the Region of Dreams. This matters to the cauchemar little: traumatizing dreamers is, after all, its own reward.\n\n#### Psychic Leeches\nThough not capable of freely travelling between the planes, cauchemars can be transported by others. Outside the Region of Dreams, a cauchemar is faced with a unique challenge posed by its inherently unstable biology. Dream-stuff is as rigid as a sand dune, and a creature composed of dream-stuff is at perpetual risk of fading into nothingness without a constant supply.\n\nFortunately for the cauchemar, leaving its home plane is not an automatic death sentence. A cauchemar can keep itself stable by feeding off the psyches of others. It is alarmingly well-adapted to feeding in this manner. A lapse as simple as forgetting the location of one's keys can be all the opening a cauchemar needs to leech energy away from a nearby creature. Indeed, entire households have perished from this, withering away with dementia-like symptoms as an unnoticed cauchemar assaulted their waking and sleeping minds.\n\n#### Unusual Nature\nThe cauchemar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. However, if outside the Region of Dreams, it requires a consistent diet of mental energy from hapless victims for sustenance. To gain the benefits of a long rest, it must either spend the entire rest in the Region of Dreams or have gained temporary hit points using its **Pernicious Feeding** trait in the past 24 hours.\n\nFor every 24 hours the cauchemar goes without benefiting from a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 levels of exhaustion.","additional_info":null,"tags":"[]","ac":12,"conditional_ac":null,"hit_dice_num":9,"hit_dice_size":8,"hp_modifier":18,"speed":"0 ft., fly 30 ft.
