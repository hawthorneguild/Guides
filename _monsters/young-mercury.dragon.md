## Young Mercury Dragon
Mercury dragons are whimsical creatures in both a physical sense and a mental one. They delight in being **unpredictable** and value **variety** above all else before moving onto the next thing that catches their attention.

#### The Spice of Life
Mercury dragons are a type of dragon with silver metallic scales that closely lock together, almost indiscernible as such from a quick glance. They move quickly and with a notable agility that makes them hard to keep up with. In combat, they are known to favor **unpredictable tactics**, even those that may be considered to be cruel or dishonorable to any outside viewer. In contrast, the dragon sees its apparent cruelty as a way to learn more about the creature before them, their natural curiosity driving them to find out if the creature is more valuable alive or if the dragon in its stale boredom should even keep them alive.

#### Mercurial Nature
Ironically, the mercury dragon's titular mercurial nature extends to its choice of lair. While typically living in **volcanic vents and tunnels**, they can also be found residing in glaciers, mountains, and even within the ever-changing **Elemental Chaos**. Mercury dragons are also known to **hoard all kinds of things** from a variety of types and sources. Their lairs can feature jewels and coins from all places, planes, and eras, as these dragons want to have at least one extra new thing to add to their collections.

This even extends to the food that they eat, which there is nothing they cannot, but they tend to prefer metallic ores. As such, a mercury dragon will strive to have something different everyday. If they do not, they end up feeling lethargic and listless due to lack of variety.

#### Creatures of Capriciousness and Cunning
One of the favored places for a mercury dragon to reside in is a lair that is maintained by another creature, preferably one that can suit its need to have variety. In a sense, they can form business relations with mages, priests, rulers, and possibly more sinister entities. This mutual relationship does not mean that the other party can guarantee the dragon's loyalty. In fact, a mercury dragon is just as likely to simply go against an arrangement if the other party attempts to cheat it, bore it with a lack of variety, or the dragon just wants to do so "just to see what happens."

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Brilliant Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales a scorching beam of light in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw additionally is blinded until the end of the dragon's next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Quicksilver Form.*** The dragon becomes a liquid wave of quicksilver and moves up to 40 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. While in quicksilver form, the dragon can't take any actions, speak, manipulate objects, or fly. It has a climbing speed of 40 feet and can enter a hostile creature's space and can stop there. In addition, it can move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it has resistance to nonmagical damage. The dragon can choose to revert back to its true form at any time on its turn (no action required) and also reverts back to its true form when it dies.
