## Yee Naaldlooshiii
In the Druidic language, yee naaldlooshii translates to "he who goes on all fours.” For those unfamiliar with the Druidic tongue, they are simply known as "skinwalkers." According to ancient legend, yee naaldlooshii are druids who sought to quickly obtain access to the highest levels of magic through the most nefarious and darkest means, by sacrificing a loved one to the powers of the Shadowfell. They are the twisted reflection of the druids they once were. Where once they represented nature and growth, yee naaldlooshii are the embodiment of corruption and unnatural decay. They perform perverse ceremonies and manipulate natural magic in opposition to the good, natural works druids traditionally perform, using their powers for evil by taking the form of animals to inflict pain and suffering on others.

Yee Naaldlooshiii are clever and use a variety of methods to lure unsuspecting victims to their death. They may pretend to be an animal snared in a trap or mimic the voice of a young woman crying out for help, only to ambush their rescuer. Occasionally they steal the faces of others, taking on the identity of a common traveler or even a member of an adventuring party traversing through their territory. These mimicries fool many, but a sharp eye and keen ear will recognize them as imitations.

Though the Yee Naaldlooshii is capable of taking on any number of beast or hybrid forms, its true form is that of their previous humanoid appearance, albeit twisted and corrupted by the abominable acts of evil they have committed.

Yee Naaldlooshii are unsettling and dreadful creatures that often carry with them the stench of death. Some yee naaldlooshii’s humanoid and beast forms may be slightly unnerving. They may appear sickly or have an awkward gait. Others are more adept at blending in and infiltrate society. A friendly old neighbor lady, whose flowers are always blighted and wilted, may be a yee naaldlooshii in a cleverly crafted disguise, using her unassuming appearance to lure her marks. Thus, from ancient forests where they can hide among flora and fauna to sprawling cities filled with dark and deserted alleys, Yee Naaldlooshii are everywhere, waiting for their next victim.

The Yee Naaldlooshii are skilled and relentless hunters, creatures of legend that are spoken of in hushed whispers and fear. Yee Naaldlooshi are beings of abject evil, delighting in the terror they can induce in others and the torments they can visit upon their victims thanks to the wide array of abilities and skills at their disposal. Yee Naaldlooshi can be nearly impossible to truly spot until it's too late, using their skills in Stealth and the pass without trace spell to remain hidden as they wish or simply pretending to be something or someone else with their ability to Shapechange and Mimicry, as well as their high Deception score. They are likely to surprise the adventuring party when they can in a frenzy of attacks or with the use of the blight or erupting earth spell, before using their Shapechange or the entangle, fog cloud, or meld into stone spells to slip away before it can be truly caught or damaged. Even when encountered face to face, they prove difficult to truly put down thanks to their powerful defensive statistics.

A Yee Naaldlooshi enjoys controlling others and manipulating them to its own ends, using its Charm to devastating effect to sow chaos among the ranks of the party and add thralls under its command. It can even bend animals under its will, Charming them and supplementing its control and influence over them from its use of speak with animals to using beast bond to spy on or harass the adventuring party. It is said that entire forests can be held under the thrall of a Yee Naaldlooshii in this way.

A Yee Naaldlooshii presents an exceptional challenge for an adventuring party, as much of the challenge involves ever being in a position to ever corner such a terrifying creature at all, all the while it continues to exhaust the party's resources and send its minions upon them while the party remains within its sights. Such monsters are likely to be the centerpiece monster of any adventure involving them, their presence felt throughout.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The yee naaldlooshii throws two Javelins or makes one Bite and two Lash attacks (Beast Form Only).
>
> ***Bite (Beast Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) Slashing damage.
>
> ***Javelin (Humanoid or Monstrosity Form Only).*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Lash (Beast Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead
or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target takes 3(1d6) poison damage at the start of its turn. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ***Charm.*** The yee naaldlooshii targets one beast or humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yee naaldlooshii, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the yee naaldlooshii. The charmed target regards the yee naaldlooshii as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the yee naaldlooshii's control, it takes the yee naaldlooshii's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the yee naaldlooshii or the yee naaldlooshii's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24
hours or until the yee naaldlooshii is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Charm of all yee naaldlooshiis for the next 24 hours.
