>
> ***Battle Dance (Recharge 5-6).*** The channeler does a battle dance causing power to radiate from the channeler in an aura with a 30-foot radius, awakening boldness in its allies. Until the channeler loses concentration as if it was concentrating on a spell, the aura moves with the channeler, centered on the channeler. While in the aura, each non-hostile creature in the aura (including the channeler) deals an extra 1d4 damage when it hits with a weapon attack.
