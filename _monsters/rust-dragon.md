## Mature Rust Dragon

*"I once met a human scholar who had been studying these hideous creatures for years. I raised objections to the name he used for them, but he refused to entertain any of my reasonable suggestions for alternatives. For his insistence, I made him eat every page of his manuscript that contained the objectionable word. Harsh, perhaps, but it had to be done."*  
*- Clathaldion, silver dragon.*

Most scholars, naturalists, and dwarven armory guards on the material plane think they have a pretty good understanding of the rust monster life cycle. They hatch from eggs, feed on ferrous metals until the time comes to molt, and then they repeat the process until they die. Unfortunately, that's not quite the complete picture.

A rust monster that grows old enough will try to make its way to **Avalas**, the first layer of the outer plane **Acheron**. It's a mystery how they manage it: perhaps it's simply luck, or perhaps they have an instinctual sense for finding portals to that plane. It's a major obstacle in either case: of the rare rust monsters that survive to old age, only a few ever find their way to Acheron. Those that do discover paradise. For a year, the creatures gorge themselves on the innards of the titanic iron cubes of that realm, carving out some of its tunnels. When they have eaten enough, the rust monsters fashion cocoons out of spun metal in which they undergo a three-year metamorphosis. When this process is complete, the rust monster emerges in a wholly new form: that of a **rust dragon**.

In appearance, rust dragons closely resemble true dragons - specifically metallic dragons - except they are more insectile in appearance. They have antennae rather than horns, their teeth are actually jagged extensions of their exoskeleton, and their flight is powered by butterfly wings. Their skin is pitted and corroded-looking (though no less protective for it), splotched with orange, brown, and blood-red highlights. A rust dragon's color is that of a type of metallic dragon's metal namesake, except oxidized.

Needless to say, it is these visual similarities that have earned them the name 'rust dragons' by humanoids who know of them. As the above anecdote demonstrates, true dragons tend to feel quite insulted by this comparison. After all, they'll say, rust 'dragons' aren't nearly as intelligent, wise, elegant, magical, humble, or even as reptilian as them. And though the similarities are a little more than skin-deep - rust dragons have most of the same physical capabilities as dragons - they clearly lack the innate magic of true dragons. Spellcasting doesn't come naturally to them, and neither do they have the kind of influence on their environments that true dragons do.

They do have breath weapons, which is enough to drive fear into a great deal of mortals - dragons included. Their acid breath is useful for personal defense, but the real danger for warriors and hoarders is their **corrosive breath**. Unlike rust monsters, rust dragons seem capable of corroding any metal into tasty rusty flakes.

#### Lifestyle
Rust dragons, even more so than their pre-metamorphosis kin, tend to be solitary creatures. They don't often interact with fellow rust dragons while roaming Acheron and when they do they quickly become embroiled in a nonfatal struggle for dominance, where the victor is the one that places its jaws around the other's head or neck.

They don't keep a hoard and rarely lair in one place, preferring to wander according to their whim. An elder rusty might keep a few choice gems and some other nonmetal items that catch its eye, as well as any magical metal items it can't corrode and digest. Rust dragons aren't typically hostile to strangers and they're intelligent enough to understand trade. They place little value on things they can't eat, and they value metals by how tasty they find them (the rarer the better, usually). It's often possible to 'buy off' a rust dragon with a sufficient quantity of precious metal, though beware that rust dragons aren't immune to greed (or gluttony, rather) either.

#### Out of Acheron
Most rust dragons prefer to stay in Acheron, but they do on occasion find their way elsewhere. Here are some suggestions for how that might occur.

| d6  | How did the rust dragon get here? |
|:---:|:-----------------------------------|
|  1  | The rusty found a sufficient quantity of metal in the material plane to carry out its metamorphosis there. |
|  2  | Someone desperately cast a *plane shift* spell on the rusty to prevent it from disarming their whole army. |
|  3  | The rusty left in search of tastier metals. |
|  4  | An ill-informed archmage summoned the rusty using a *gate* spell and it promptly rusted through its cage. |
|  5  | A spiteful chromatic dragon lured the rusty here to torment metallics. |
|  6  | The rusty stumbled through a portal by accident and can't find its way back home. |

#### Rust Dragon Connections
In Acheron, there is a race of 15-foot tall, highly intelligent quadrupedal birds known as **Achaierai** who sometimes gather rust dragon cocoons, tend to them carefully, and raise the emerging rust dragons as beloved pets and prized tunnelers. Rust dragons raised this way are much more sociable with other rust dragons as well.

Here are some more examples of connections a rust dragon might form with other creatures.

| d8  | Connection |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | A militant druid tries to bond with this rusty, hoping to use it to purge manufactured metal from this world. |
|  2  | An adventuring band travels with a rusty that they keep docile by feeding it electrum coins and looted gear. |
|  3  | A brass dragon tries to teach a rusty how to act like a proper dragon, far away from its own hoard. |
|  4  | A rusty shepherds a group of rust monsters through life. |
|  5  | A duergar leader promises an adamantine reward to a rusty if it destroys the armory of their enemies. |
|  6  | An artist is enamored with the patterns and colors of a rusty's exoskeleton 'skin'. |
|  7  | A scholar is determined to study rust dragons, even under threats and harassment by true dragons. |
|  8  | A rusty bound or hired to guard a dungeon is constantly tormented by hunger for its construct colleagues. |

>
> ***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the rust dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Rust Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust dragon corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust dragon is destroyed after dealing damage.
