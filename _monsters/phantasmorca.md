## Phantasmorca

***"They say that there are many wonders that goes through the mind when one is in the midst of a well rested slumber.  Through the most pleasant of dreams and most sinister of nightmares, they say that you can hear a certain song calling out for you. Whether you consider this a blessing or an omen is not something you need to do in hindsight. Seeing is believing. Dreaming is in the imagination."***

Wandering in the Astral Plane, travellers sometimes encounter a phenomenon where they could see small pockets of space distorting in various places around them. Assuming it might be a normal occurrence in the plane, the travellers think nothing of it and move on. However, little do the foolhardy travellers know, the distortion continues to move closer and closer to them, but it is not giving chase as some sort of predatory creature. Rather, they are in the direct feeding path of a creature large enough to swallow them whole, a creature that they thought they would've seen coming from a mile away.  Sailing through the Astral Plane, a phantasmorca
resembles an adult humpback whale with glowing fronds and patches on its body. It travels through the plane seemingly in a permanent trance and acts similar to a whale in its demeanor and behavioral patterns. However, most travellers to the Astral Plane are unable to see it for what it is until they are close enough to collide with it or get swallowed up by its massive maw. Unfortunately, the ships who come across a phantasmorca on the Astral Sea usually leads to them being shoved off course simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

**Distorted Presence**. In the Astral Plane, a phantasmorca's body cannot be seen by the naked eye as some kind of force is bending around it in order to shield it from potential threats. Keen eyed individuals would see the phantasmorca's strange visual distortion as a ripple in the Astral Plane that would occasionally grow or shrink. However, when a creature approaches the phantamorca during an investigation, they will see its true form by way of approaching it from behind or when they are about to be swallowed by it.

**Maw to Nowhere**. Looking into the maw of a phantasmorca will reveal nothing but a black hole to where no light could illuminate. This has puzzled many sages over the years as to what can be found inside or how a phantasmorca could gain sustenance to sustain its massive body.  However, taking in some eyewitness accounts from certain individuals that have appeared from beyond, it is said that the maw of a phantamorca is not a cold desolate hole in which hope is lost. In fact, they even say that on the other side, there exists a place where dreams were made real. Rather, they found themselves in the dream of those they knew and those
they did not. 

**Paradoxical Existence in a Realm of Dreams.**  Phantasmorca are creatures that originate from within the Region of Dreams and are born when a dreamscape becomes powerful enough to be more than a little short session. When dreams begin to connect and become continuous, a phantasmorca is born and made manifest, resembling an infantile whale calf. While a phantasmorca normally resembles a humpback whale or any other type of baleen whale, an extremely rare variant of the phantasmorca is born as the result of a nightmare going under the same transformation. These nightmare phantasmorca are more aggressive and resemble toothed whales. The phantasmorca resides within the Region of Dreams, but can project itself in the Astral Sea, when it happens, the phantasmorca will exist at the same time both in the Astral Plane and in the Region of Dreams. It appears as an adult within the Astral Plane and as a calf in the Region of Dreams.
Very few individuals are sure on how long they live, but many can agree that the number of phantasmorca are equal to the amount of closely connected dreams that are created. If a phantasmorca is slain in the Astral Plane, its counterpart in the Region of Dreams also dies. If a phantasmorca is slain in the Region of Dreams, it will reform within 30 days as long as its counterpart in the Astral Plane is still alive.

**Prized Commodity**. Due to their generally docile nature and rare appearance, phantasmorca are often hunted down for a variety of parts and are a subject of study. Inquisitive scholars are still finding out more things about the phantasmorca while collectors would be willing to pay mountains of gold for one of its baleen combs.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Visual Distortion.*** The phantasmorca has an area of distorted visual space within 10 feet of it that obscures it from creatures that view it from beyond 10 feet. It can see and hear outside of this area normally. Creatures outside of the visual distortion that are affected by its **Consuming Void** must make the Strength saving throw at disadvantage. Creatures native to the Region of Dreams such as a kalashtar and quori are aware of a phantasmorca within 300 feet of them even when the visual distortion obscures it.
>
> ***Dreaming Existence.*** The phantasmorca is immune to the *dream* spell and any effect that would put it to sleep. Both the Astral Plane and the Region of Dreams counterparts of the phantasmorca can't leave their respective planes, nor can they be banished or otherwise be transported out of them.
>
> ***Paradox in the Region of Dreams.*** The phantasmorca exists as an adult in the Astral Plane and as a calf in the Region of Dreams. If the phantasmorca is killed on the Astral Plane, its counterpart in the Region of Dreams also dies. If the phantasmorca is killed in the Region of Dreams, it will reform within 30 days of dying as long as its counterpart in the Astral Plane is still alive.
>
> ***Hold Breath.*** The phantasmorca can hold its breath for 90 minutes.
>
> ***Echolocation.*** The phantasmorca can't use its blindsight while deafened.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The phantasmorca makes two attacks: one with its **Headbutt** and one with its **Tail**.
>
> ***Headbutt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage. On hit, the targeted creature is knocked 10 feet away from the phantasmorca.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage, or 45 (6d10 + 12) bludgeoning damage if the target is an object.
>
> ***Consuming Void (Recharges on 5-6).*** The phantasmorca opens its mouth and inhales, drawing in Large or smaller creatures and objects that are not worn or carried into its mouth. Targets within a 30-foot cone must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or take 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and be pulled into the phantasmorca's mouth. A swallowed creature has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the phantasmorca. If the phantasmorca takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the phantasmorca must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all consumed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the whale. If the phantasmorca dies, a swallowed creature can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone. If a swallowed creature ends their turn inside the mouth of the phantasmorca, they are sent to a dreamscape in the Region of Dreams as determined by the DM.
