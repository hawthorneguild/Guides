## Jack Frost

Jack frosts are fey spirits of ice and cold who play dangerous games with the lives of mortals who wander into their territory. Cruel and capricious, they take great joy in the cold, frigid death of others, and will play elaborate games with the lives of those passing through their lands. Lurking near mountain tops or in arctic terrain, they delight in tormenting helpless creatures and subsist on the body heat that they drain from victims.

**Deadly Shapechangers**. Jack frosts have several forms and can change from one to another at will. They may appear as a flurry of beautiful and intricately patterned snowflakes, a vaporous white cloud, or as small, pale blue fey with silver eyes and white or silvery icicle-like hair. Even in the heaviest snow or coldest region, they wear only gauzy white clothing and go barefoot. Those who might be identified as males wear tunics and trousers, while those regarded as females
prefer gowns. They all have mischievous, beguiling smiles, and speak their own language amongst themselves.

**Chilling Predators**. In their snowflake forms, jack frosts are so beautiful that anyone viewing them falling from the sky and tumbling about are typically hypnotized by their loveliness. Once they have gotten close to their victims through this ruse, these ice spirits are seen as clouds of freezing vapor, and it is not uncommon for several jack frosts to combine and create a larger cloud. In this form they are able to sweep across their victims, chilling them to their very core.
After the initial attack, they have been known to change into their true forms to touch victims with chilling grasps, or to nip them with freezing, numbing bites. A jack frost’s touch sends a searing, freezing shock through its victim’s body that drains them of their body heat and prevents them from moving.  A bite from the jack frost renders the part bitten numb, and the favored targets for a jack frost’s bite are the lips, nose, ears, fingertips and the toes. The jack frost’s nip causes frostbite, and if the injured region is not properly tended to within the hour through gentle warming or the like, the part will have to be amputated as gangrene will set in.

**Arctic Wanderers**. Jack frosts wander the arctic landscape seeking nourishment in the form of body heat and amusement in the torment of mortals, possessing several powers that endanger travelers in the regions they inhabit.  They have no true society as such, existing to play elaborate games. Their thought processes are completely alien to mortals, being composed of strange yearnings and sly, incomprehensible ploys to “win” the latest game, whatever it may be.

**Unusual Ecology**. Jack frosts have no true sexes and reproduce by warming to the point of melting and reforming as two creatures. They often take treasure gained from former victims and strew it about to attract other prey to their current wandering grounds. Other than this, however, they have no use for such trinkets.

#### Frostbite
This disease affects a creature bitten by a jack frost, in which symptoms occur 1d4 hours after infection and involves gangrene setting into a bitten body part. Before the symptoms occur, the infected creature must be tended to by gentle warming lasting for at least 10 minutes, or by spells or effects that remove disease. If not treated, the infected creature gains a **Lingering Injury** and the disease is then removed.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Extinguishing Aura.*** At the start of each of the jack frost’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage, and nonmagical light sources within 60 feet are snuffed out. A creature also takes 7 (2d6) cold damage if it touches the jack frost or hits it with a melee attack while within 10 feet.
>
> ***Flyby.*** The jack frost doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The jack frost’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
**At will:** *fog cloud, frost fingers, heat metal (cold), ray of frost (11th level, two beams)*  
**1/day each:** *cone of cold, ice storm, wall of ice*
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The jack frost has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The jack frost regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If it takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. It dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** In a cold region, the jack frost can use its action to polymorph into a Medium cloud of mist or revert to its true form.  
While in mist form, it appears as a shimmering cloud of snowflakes, can only use its *Touch* or *Hypnotizing Pattern* actions, and cannot speak or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 60 ft., can hover, and can enter other creatures’ spaces. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and is immune to all nonmagical damage.
>
> ***Unearthly Grace.*** The jack frost’s AC includes its Charisma bonus.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The jack frost makes two attacks: one with its *Touch* and one with its *Bite*, or two *Icicle Spear* attacks.
>
> ***Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 5) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Bite (Fey Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract frostbite. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by the cold damage taken, and the jack frost regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ***Icicle Spear (Fey Form Only).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
>
> ***Hypnotizing Pattern (Mist Form Only).*** The jack frost casts *hypnotic pattern* (save DC 17) centered on itself.
>
> ***Polar Midnight (1/Day).*** The jack frost plunges an area  within 60 feet of it into the brutal chill of the arctic night. A 30-foot-radius sphere of nonmagical darkness spreads out from that point. The darkness spreads around corners. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the jack frost's concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell), or if the effect is dispelled (as a 7th-level spell). As a bonus action on the jack frost's turn, it can move the area up to 10 feet in a direction of its choice. 

A creature that starts its turn inside of the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 14 (4d6) cold damage. A creature that ends its turn inside of the area is encased in a sheath of ice, unless it is immune to cold damage. While encased in ice, a creature is restrained and cannot breathe. A restrained creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this saving throw three times, it is turned to ice and subjected to the petrified condition. The ice around the creature can be damaged and breached to free the trapped creature; it has AC 5, 20 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. A creature killed while encased in ice, or petrified, is transmuted into solid ice, and can only be revived by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.
