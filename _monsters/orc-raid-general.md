> ### Traits
>
> ***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.
>
> ***Brave.*** The orc has advantage on saving throws against being **frightened**.
>
> ***Gruumsh's Fury.*** The orc deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage when it hits with a weapon attack (included in the attacks below).
>
> ***Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the orc takes 21 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The orc uses its Intimidating Presence and makes three attacks with its Greataxe or Javelin.
>
> ***Greataxe.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +9, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (1d12 + 5 plus 2d8) Slashing damage.
>
> ***Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +9, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (1d6 + 5 plus 2d8) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Intimidating Presence.*** One creature of the raid general's choice that is within 60 feet of it and aware of its presence must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** until the end of the raid general's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the raid general's Intimidating Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Battle Cry (1/Day).*** Each creature of the raid general's choice that is within 30 feet of it, can hear it, and is not already affected by Battle Cry gains advantage on attack rolls until the start of the raid general's next turn. The raid general can then make one attack as a bonus action.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Last Stand.*** When the raid general's hit points are reduced to 21 or less, it can make one weapon attack with advantage.
