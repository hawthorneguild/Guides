## The Sandman

#### Traditional Myth
In traditional tales, the Sandman appears in many stories that parents tell their children. The tiny 'sleep' found on a person's eyes upon waking is supposedly the magical sand or grit sprinkled into a sleeping child’s eyes to get them to sleep peacefully. For the children that are particularly naughty and refuse to fall asleep, the Sandman's "sleep" causes their eyes to fall out, which are then collected and put away in his sack. The Sandman is then said to steal away the naughty child to his castle on the moon, as sustenance for his offspring. Some parents ameliorate the tale so that the Sandman is said to be a supportive but still a capricious helper, using the threat of the Sandman to coerce wakeful children into sleeping. However, the softening of the tale about the mysterious being is a kindness to the Sandman's true nature.

#### Dark Origin
The Sandman is a mysterious entity, and many theories exist about his origin. The most commonly accepted story was that the Sandman was once a brilliant arcanist that was unable to have children of his own. After many years of work he attempted to make the perfect daughter through magic. However, she was never fully 'alive'but was a construct with an uncanny appearance and no empathy for those around her. The arcanist, unable to bear the sight of others looking at his glassy-eyed daughter with disdain, would kidnap people to enact his wrath and his daughter's cruel wishes. After many years, some mysterious powers recognized the evil acts they both performed, and they were pulled into a demesne bordering the **Region of Dreams** and the **Demiplane of Nightmares**. When he was cast away to this border region, the Sandman lost all sense of self, becoming a haunting, dishevelled being.

#### Nightly Visitor
The Sandman is said to reside in a wondrous castle that overlooks a sea of liquid sand and is filled with hundreds of life-like, servant constructs. He exists only to serve his daughter, changing the very landscape of his domain to please her, and fetching whatever she desires. Each night, the Sandman scours the planes to haunt people in their sleep and to learn more about those that exist outside of his realm. On occasion, he escapes from his domain and into the world, stealing wakeful children and bringing them to his residence so they can forever reside with his false daughter.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Discorporation.*** When the Sandman drops to 0 hit points or dies, his body is destroyed but his essence travels back to his domain, where he gains a new body in 1d10 days.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Sandman's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
> At will: *detect magic, detect thoughts, major image, sleep* (as a 4th-level spell)
> 3/day each: *counterspell, creation, dispel magic, dream, plane shift* (only self and up to one incapacitated creature which is considered willing for the spell)
>
> ***Fallible Invisibility.*** The Sandman is invisible. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:
> * The Sandman appears as a gaunt, dishevelled-looking humanoid if observed through a glass lens.
> * The Sandman appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a brass oil lamp held by a parent.
> * Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the Sandman fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The Sandman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Trackless.*** The Sandman leaves no tracks to indicate where he has been or where he's headed.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack***. The Sandman makes two attacks. If he attacks with his claws and both claw attacks hit a humanoid, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses
an action to shake or slap it awake. 
>
> ***Claws***. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the Sandman has advantage on the attack roll, the target also takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
>
> ***Sleeping Sand***. The Sandman sprinkles sand in the eyes of an unconscious creature within 5 feet of him. While the sand remains, the creature is paralyzed. The effect ends after 8 hours, or if a creature takes an action to remove the sand.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Sandman can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another
creature's turn. The Sandman regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Attack.** The Sandman makes one weapon attack.
>
> **Scarper.** The Sandman moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks, or he takes the Hide
>
> **Sleep (Costs 2 Actions).** The Sandman uses his Sleeping Sand or he casts sleep (as a 4th-level spell) as per his Innate Spellcasting.
>
> ### Lair Actions
>
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Sandman takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> * Until initiative count 20 of the next round, the Sandman can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if they weren't there.
> * The Sandman targets any number of doors and windows that he can see, causing each one to either open or close as he wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until he chooses to make them unlocked, or until he uses this lair action again to open them.
> * The Sandman selects terrain, one creature, or one object that is part of an illusion spell that he has cast and makes it real for 1 minute. A creature made real in this way has a CR of 4 or below and rolls its own initiative in combat, acting independently of the Sandman but always obeys his commands. Any hazardous terrain made real in this way deals 4d10 damage of an appropriate damage type, with DC 17 for any associated saving throws of an appropriate type. A magic item made real in this way cannot be an artifact, cannot affect anything outside the Sandman's domain, any effects associated with it cannot leave or persist beyond the Sandman's domain, and any ongoing effects associated with the item immediately expire upon leaving the Sandman's domain. The Sandman can attune to a magic item made real in this way using an action on his turn.
> * The Sandman creates a duplicate of himself, which appears within 5 feet of him. As long as he can see his duplicate, the Sandman can move it a distance equal to his walking speed as well as make the duplicate speak on his turn (no action required). The duplicate has the same statistics as the Sandman but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The duplicate seems real in every way but crumbles into sand if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the Sandman dismisses it (no action required) or if he can no longer see it. If the Sandman uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one crumbles into sand, dropping any real objects in its possession.
>
> ### Regional Effects
>
> The region containing the Sandman's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
> * Corridors and pathways within the lair twist and turn back on themselves, making navigation in the area exceedingly difficult.
> * New structures appear on occasion, and existing ones can shift or change in size or appearance.
> * Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of friends, family members, and things that they desire. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.
> * Duplicates of the Sandman appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). A duplicate is made of sand, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the Sandman. The Sandman can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of his duplicate and can interact with them as if he were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the duplicate takes any damage, it crumbles into sand.
>
> If the Sandman dies, these regional effects end immediately.
