## Chaos Hound
Putrid fiends that resemble decaying dogs, **chaos hounds** are found throughout the Abyss and other parts of the Lower Planes. On the Material Plane, they are most commonly seen in the service of powerful demons and other evil creatures that use them as trackers and hunters.

### Crawling Flesh
A chaos hound appears to be a large hound whose flesh crawls ceaselessly across its body. Upon closer inspection, the creature can be more accurately seen as a decaying hound with a jet-black skeleton covered by maggots that squirm as they await their next meal. When moving the hound becomes insubstantial, appearing as a ghostly blur that leaves behind a lingering scent of decay. The maggots that make up its flesh ooze acid at all times; this acid leaves pools wherever the chaos hound stands. When the chaos hound feeds on a corpse, the maggots from its body swarm to feast. Gorged and bloated, they reattach to the chaos hound, causing it to look fat and agitated.  The chaos hound gives off an aura of decay. The smell can be detected from hundreds of feet away and lingers for hours after its passing.

### Relentless Trackers
Chaos hounds are vicious fiends that **relentlessly track** their prey. Once they have the scent of a target, they will not stop until they are slain or their prey is consumed. When the chaos hound devours its target, it not only consumes the flesh but also the **soul**.

### Devourer of Souls
A chaos hound may feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both the flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the chaos hound for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the chaos hound dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released. While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a chaos hound, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the chaos hound if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, the creature may only be returned to life by a wish spell or divine intervention.
