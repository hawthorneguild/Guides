## Young Magmeleon

Magmeleon are rare lizardlike creatures with small wings protruding from their back and torchlike tail continually aflame. Their eggs are hidden inside volcanoes for safety and hatch only during volcanic eruptions. As such, some followers of **Kossuth** see them as a blessing from the Firelord and a sign of good luck.

#### Heat Rises
While a magmeleon is born with wings, its dense body makes it difficult to achieve flight and is only able to sustain flight for short distances. As it ages, its wings grow larger and stronger and it is able to sustain its flight for a longer duration.

#### Born In Fire
The Magmeleon is most comfortable in extreme heat and can be found swimming in pools of lava like most other creatures in a pond. However, their bodies so closely resemble the lava and magma surrounding them that they are almost impossible to spot.

#### Puff of Flame
If lucky enough to come across one you may wish to pet and hug the creature but like many dragons it won't hesitate to defend itself with a blast of scorching flame from its mouth. Unlike most though this young dragon's breath is much smaller but just as deadly.

If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
>
> ***Ember (Recharge 5-6).*** The magmeleon exhales fire in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
