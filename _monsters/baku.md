## Baku

**Baku** are celestial beings that serve the goddess **Kwan Ying** by traversing the planes and devouring nightmares. While they can be found nearly anywhere on any plane where people dream, their iconography is most frequently found in **Kara-Tur**. According to Shou Lung legend, a person who wakes from a bad dream can call out to a baku three times for it to devour their nightmare. But calling for a baku must be done sparingly because, if it remains hungry after eating the nightmare, it may also devour the dreamer's hopes and desires, leaving behind a shell of a person. There is but only a little truth to this legend, for baku are creatures of good intent.

#### Kwan Ying's Nightmare Eaters
Baku serve their creator, Kwan Ying, the Sapphire Empress of Kara-Tur's Celestial Bureaucracy. Long ago, shortly after the beginning of humankind, Kwan Ying noticed that many of her followers were suffering in their sleep. Knowing that these bad dreams were destined to be consumed by **Dendar** if nothing was done to prevent them and wanting to end suffering, the Compassionate Kwan Ying traveled to the **Region of Dreams** and created the first baku from stray pieces of dream matter made real through her divine touch. She instructed the baku to travel the planes and ease the suffering of dreamers by devouring nightmares before Dendar could sink her fangs into them.

#### Celestial Chimera
While baku are spiritual beings that hail from the Region of Dreams, they have well-defined physical appearances. A baku is a **chimera**, typically having the body of a bear, trunk of an elephant, paws of a tiger, tail of an ox, and eyes of a rhinoceros. Beyond their chimeric composition, however, baku vary in appearance and coloration. Some baku have several sets of eyes or multiple tusks. And while tiger ears are most common, some baku have ox or elephant ears.

#### Dreamscapers
The celestial dream eater doesn't just gain sustenance from nightmares and dreams, it can also mold them and change them on a whim. Baku usually use this ability to collect the nightmare energies and create a new dream for the sleeping mortal to enjoy while they eat. In addition, while within the Region of Dreams, a baku can take on the shape of any beast. These two abilities render the baku the ultimate dreamscaper.

#### A Hunted Species
Creatures that thrive on nightmares terrorizing sleeping mortals threaten the baku's existence. Centuries of being hunted by servants of Dendar, night hags, fech, and the like have led to the near extinction of the already rare baku. Today, these servants of Kwan Ying are less trusting of beings they don't know. Baku are likely to remain invisible or disguise themselves as a beast and watch the strangers for a while to determine whether or not they can be trusted. Only after a baku determines that a stranger is unlikely to do it harm will it openly approach them.

#### Beings of Mercy
Baku were created to help end and prevent suffering, not spread it. Ever hungry, they most frequently use their abilities to seek out and consume unpleasant dreams. When baku run into trouble, they prefer to flee or incapacitate their enemies. They only resort to lethal measures when there is no other means of escape or when a nearby dreaming mortal's life is threatened.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Dream Sense.*** The baku can sense the presence of a dreaming humanoid within 1,000 feet of it. It can determine the location of the humanoid and whether the humanoid's dream is influenced by the Demiplane of Nightmares. A *protection from evil and good* spell cast on the target prevents the baku from being able to sense the dreaming humanoid, as does a *magic circle*.
>
> ***Fear Devourer.*** Whenever the baku is subjected to the frightened condition, it isn't frightened and instead regains 10 hit points.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The baku's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
> 
> At will: *calm emotions, light*
> 
> 2/day: *plane shift* (self only)
> 
> 1/day: *feeblemind*
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the baku fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Magic Weapons.*** The baku's weapon attacks are magical.
>
> ***Nightmare Eater.*** If the baku is in the Region of Dreams, it regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the baku moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a **Claw** attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the baku can make one **Gore** attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** While in the Region of Dreams, the baku can use its action to polymorph into a Large or smaller beast or back into its true form, which is celestial. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies or leaves the Region of Dreams.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The baku makes two attacks: one with its **Gore** and one with its **Claws**.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d4 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The baku exhales a beam of psionic energy through its trunk in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Any creatures that fail must also subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of the baku's next turn.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The baku can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The baku regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> ***Claws.*** The baku makes one attack with its **Claws**.
>
> ***Limited Invisibility.*** The baku targets one creature within 500 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or the baku becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the baku attacks the target.
>
> ***Dreamy Daze (2 Actions).*** A 15-foot-radius sphere of magical confusion extends from a point the baku can see within 60 feet of it and spreads around corners. Each creature that starts its turn in that area is treated as if targeted by the *confusion* spell (save DC 17). The sphere lasts as long as the baku maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell).
>
> ### Lair Actions
> The baku can assert its dominion over the dreamscapes around it to take lair actions in the **Region of Dreams**, treating any dreamscape it's in as its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the baku uses its lair action to cause one of the following effects:
>
> * The baku warps a single dreamscape around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of the baku's choice. The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a part of the dreamscape. The transformation lasts until the baku dies, the dreamer wakes, or the baku uses this lair action again.
> * The baku teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.
> * The baku shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another dreamscape.
