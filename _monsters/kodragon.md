## Kodragon

The kodragon is a rare species of dragon that solely exists on the Astral Plane. They are shaped like a dragon, but have gray fur instead of scales, and their wings are bat-like and leathery. Their foreclaws have opposable thumbs just like humans. They speak in light voices which makes them sound like a child. These inquisitive and talkative dragons love art and knowledge. Although they tend to be solitary in their travels, their curiosity leads them to interact with people.  However, this curiosity sometimes leads them into trouble. Their opposable thumbs allow them to use a special clay tablet and stylus that they use to make records, but each has a different idea has to what needs to be recorded. They typically
do not use any other tools. Kodragons have a high level of wanderlust. However, for some, when they get older, that desire to wander fades, and they will instead choose to maintain the secret repositories where kodragons leave their tablets. Other kodragons are sometimes employed as emissaries or agents to astral dragons given their eloquence and record keeping skills. 

Kodragons give live birth to their children.They have a pouch on their abdomen where their infants are kept safe, which operates in a similar fashion as a bag of holding, being much bigger inside than it seems. Kodragons often use this pouch to hold their tablets and styluses.  Kodragons sustain themselves by drinking liquid of any kind.  

#### Tactics

Kodragons tend to avoid combat whenever possible, but if forced to fight or defend themselves, they will stay aloft, allowing them to maneuver in the air, and fly by their enemies to claw and bite them, and then fly out of range. They can dart through the air and around their enemies very quickly, which makes them extremely hard to hit while in flight. Kodragons have two magical breath weapons, one that shrinks its target, and the other one brings them back to their initial size. However, the latter breath doesn't reverse other means of shrinking, but instead only reverses the effect of its shrinking breath. A kodragon will usually try to open the fight by shrinking their enemies before attacking them in melee. If they are in a dire situation, they will either teleport or plane shift away to survive.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aerial Maneuvers.*** Attack rolls against the kodragon have disadvantage while it is flying. Additionally while it is flying, if the kodragon is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails, provided it isn’t incapacitated.
>
> ***Flyby.*** The kodragon doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
>
> ***Pouch of Holding.*** The kodragon has an abdominal pouch with an interior space larger than its outside dimensions and that can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The kodragon can use a bonus action to retrieve or to store an item in its pouch.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The kodragon’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: plane shift (self only)
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The kodragon makes three attacks: one with its Bite and two with its Claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. ***Hit:*** 1 slashing damage.
>
> ***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons. 
> 
> * **Shrinking Breath**. The kodragon exhales a 5-foot radius sphere of shrinking gas centered on a point within 5 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or have its size decreased by three categories for 1d4 hours. While the creature’s size is decreased, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and additionally the target’s weapon attacks that use Strength have disadvantage and deal only half damage. This effect ends early on a creature if the dispel magic spell is cast on it. 
> 
> * **Restoring Breath**. The kodragon exhales a 5-foot radius sphere of gas centered on a point within 5 feet of it. Each creature in that area that had its size decreased by the kodragon’s shrinking breath is restored to its normal size.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Astral Step.*** The kodragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.
