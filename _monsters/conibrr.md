## Conibrr

In the harsh, cold forests of northern Faerûn, occasionally, a coniferous tree will awaken. However, unlike typical treants -- flora blessed by the fey who act as guardians of the wild -- these trees are often awoken through the actions and presence of malevolent entities. Whether it be the machinations of a devil or demon, magical essence from nearby drow, or simply a fey creature of ill intent, the awakening of a conibrr usually results in something that cares far more for destruction than preservation.

**Twisted Relatives**. A conibrr, much like a treant, is a tree given sapience. Specifically, it is a coniferous tree given sapience through the influence of dark powers. They spend most of their time rooted in the ground, giving the appearance of a normal tree, only uprooting to attack nearby creatures when it suits their mood. Unlike most treants, conibrrs lack eyes, mouths, or faces of any kind, and are unable to speak, hear, read, or write. They do understand the languages of those who awoke them, but the only way to communicate with them is via telepathy, which they do not possess naturally.

**Contempt for Nature**. Conibrrs do not particularly care for the forest in which they awoke, or life in general, and will gladly attack nearby wildlife when given the chance. The area in the immediate vicintiy of a connibrr will usually be devoid of any animal life, as the animals nearby will quickly learn that approaching the area is unsafe. Loggers, hunters, and others who might face the brunt of a treant's wrath for their actions will typically not awaken a conibrr's ire, though if they get too close the conibrr will often attack them for sport anyway.

**Self-preservation**. Conibrrs will not attack a creature they believe to be much stronger than them, except in self-defense. Instead, they will rely on their natural camouflage to keep themselves safe. Though they lack typical sight, they can sense nearby living things, as well as heat, and will flee the area if necessary to avoid burning down.

**Solitary Flora**. It is rare for multiple conibrrs to awaken in the same area; when such a situation occurs, one conibrr will typically drive the other out, or one will leave of its own accord. Conibrrs encountered in the wild are thus typically found alone.

**Acidic Sap**. The awakening of a conibrr causes its sap to turn into a caustic acid. A thin layer of this sap coats the conibrr, as well as its needles (which it can jettison from itself at will), making direct contact extremely dangerous. Damaging a conibrr often causes this sap to spew forth from the resulting gash, damaging the attacker in kind.

**Photosynthetic Nature**. A conibrr does not need to breathe, but it must remain rooted for at least 12 hours a day in order to meet its required fluid uptake. It gets its energy via sunlight, and is not carnivorous; all destruction it unleashes is entirely for destruction's sake.
