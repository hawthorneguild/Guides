> ### Traits
>
> ***Amphibious.*** The toad can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Hungry.*** If the toad has no creatures swallowed and grapples a creature with its bite attack, it can immediately use Swallow as a bonus action.
>
> ***Poison Skin.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the toad takes 7 (2d6) poison damage.
>
> ***Standing Leap.*** The toad’s long jump is up to 20 ft. and its high jump is up to 10 ft., with or without a running start.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The toad uses its Spore Cloud then makes one Bite attack.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) Piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) Poison damage, and the target is **grappled** (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is **restrained**, and the toad can’t bite another target.
>
> ***Spore Cloud.*** The toad ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** and **incapacitated** for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also **swallowed**, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is **blinded** and **restrained**, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the toad’s turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the toad must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls **prone** in a space within 10 ft. of the toad. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 ft. of movement, exiting prone.
