## Figgy Pudding

In some homes, Midwinter is a time of feasting with family and friends, enjoying each other's warmth and distracting themselves from the harsh cold and hard times that remain before spring. Only after plates have been cleared and the warm ciders are in hand around the fire do they begin to tell tales of Midwinter celebrations where the guests didn't make it past dessert—where festivities were cut short by the Figgy Pudding.

#### Boozie Ooze
Some say the Figgy Pudding is accidentally made when the dish’s ingredients are combined in the wrong order. Others say every Figgy Pudding is a “Deadwinter” gift from Juiblex. No matter the truth, one thing is certain: once the brandy-smothered pudding is set ablaze, the ooze doubles in size and begins its own feast, consuming and flambéing every creature in its path until it's the only merrymaker left.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the pudding remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a warm and sticky figgy pudding.
>
> ***Feed on Fire.*** Whenever the pudding is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead its size increases by one category. If there isn’t enough room for the pudding to increase in size, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available. While the pudding is Large or bigger, it makes Strength checks and saving throws with advantage. If the pudding starts its turn at Gargantuan size, the pudding releases energy in an explosion. Each creature within 30 feet of the pudding must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. The pudding’s size then becomes Medium, and it expels any creatures that can no longer fit inside of it.
>
> ***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Illumination.*** The pudding sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
>
> ***Ooze Dome.*** The pudding takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the pudding’s Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the pudding can’t be seen and have total cover. 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, plus 13 (4d4 + 3) acid damage, plus 13 (4d4 + 3) fire damage.
>
> ***Engulf.*** The pudding moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter creatures’ spaces of a size equal to or smaller than the pudding’s size. Whenever the pudding enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the pudding. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the pudding enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage and 7 (2d6) fire damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is **restrained**, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of the pudding’s turns. When the pudding moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the pudding.
>
> ***Flambé Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The pudding exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ***Snowball.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage.
