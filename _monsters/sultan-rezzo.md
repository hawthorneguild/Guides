## Sultan Rezzo the Marvelous

Sultan Rezzo is a noble marid who reigns in a magnificent palace in the Elemental Plane of Water. He occasionally gives quests to Hawthorne Guild members. As long as the Hawthorne Guild remains in good standing with the Sultan, the guild will have freedom of access to the portal leading to an area near his palace in the Elemental Plane of Water.

Sultan Rezzo is a kind and benevolent Marid as long as he is given the respect he considers himself to deserve. Otherwise, his fury can be as violent as the ocean when a storm causes waves to crash and sink ships and anyone inside it. He is the benevolent ruler of his palace, he gives his slaves many liberties and treats them fairly well. He is more interested in having slaves for the sake of ownership than actually making them do anything they wouldn't want to. However, it seems pretty clear that his slaves are quite happy with their lives and are staying in the palace of their own will. Among those slaves, his two favorites are Brooke the Swift, a water genasi, and Aukai the Wanderer, a sea elf. They often serve as his messengers and emissaries.

### Sultan Rezzo's Palace
Sultan Rezzo's palace is a grandiose building covered in coral and algae. It is filled with wonders and sensory delights that goes beyond one's wildest dreams. This opulent palace floats in a deep part of the Plane of Water and contains many luxurious chambers and rooms filled with air for his guests or slaves.

### Roleplaying Sultan Rezzo
Rezzo is a Marid who sees himself as a superior being and expects to be treated as such. He wears fine and colorful clothes that resemble outfits usually seen in the Calimshan region.

Rezzo has a great sense of self-importance, and considers himself, as well as other Marids, above all other kinds of genies. He tolerates djinn, dislikes dao, and despises efreet. Bribery and flattery are the best means for a humanoid to earn Rezzo's favor. In an adventuring group, whoever praises him the most will be seen by Rezzo as the most intelligent or worthy of the group and assume they are the leader. Rezzo loves to tell stories about himself or legends he knows, and although he will not directly lie about the events he recounts, he will greatly embellish them. He hates being interrupted while telling his stories, and will only offer a single warning before unleashing his wrath should this great offense be done to him.

***Personality Trait.*** There's nothing I like more than finding a new skillful slave.

***Ideal.*** Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good)

***Bond.*** I will do anything to prove myself superior to other genies.

***Flaw.*** Flattery brings down my defenses and I tend to be less cautious of those who compliment me.

***Quirk.*** I will always invite the one I deem most worthy in an adventuring group to join my kingdom as a slave.

#### Additional Notes
- Sultan Rezzo's crown is a ***helm of telepathy***. He frequently scans the surface thoughts of his guests to try and gauge them.
- Rezzo is a difficult individual to gauge or read and attempts to magically discern his thoughts or know if he is lying are foiled by his ***ring of mind shielding***.
- He continually maintains the ***tongues*** spell on himself to be able to speak with all manner of visitors from across the planes without issue.
- He has three ***sending stones*** linked to servants of his court on his person at all times.

>

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Rezzo makes two trident attacks and uses his Water Jet.
> 
> ***Trident of Recall +1.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack*: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage, or 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If Rezzo throws the weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, it flies back to his hand after the attack. If Rezzo doesn't have a hand free, the trident lands at his feet.
> 
> ***Water Jet.*** Rezzo magically shoots water in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 30 feet away from Rezzo and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.
>
> ***Waterspout .*** While underwater or on the surface of a body of water (pond size or larger), Rezzo magically transforms into a Huge waterspout, with any equipment he was wearing or carrying merging with his waterspout form. 
>
> While in waterspout form, Rezzo can't take any actions except to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Search, use his Vortex action, or to return to his true form as a bonus action. Furthermore, while in waterspout form, Rezzo is immune to all damage except fire damage, and Rezzo ignores difficult terrain and can't be grappled, paralyzed, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or have his movement speed reduced. 
>
> In addition, while in waterspout form, Rezzo can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there, and he can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. While in waterspout form, when Rezzo enters a Huge or smaller creature's space for the first time on a turn or a Huge or smaller creature enters his space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in his space, Rezzo can push the creature up to 15 feet away from him in a straight line.
>
> If at any time Rezzo is no longer underwater or no longer in contact with a body of water (pond size or larger) while in waterspout form, he immediately reverts to his true form.
> 
> ***Vortex (Waterspout Form Only).*** Rezzo becomes a swirling vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Rezzo can maintain this state by taking this action again on subsequent rounds, and this state ends if Rezzo ends his turn without having used this action. This state also ends if Rezzo is no longer in waterspout form.
>
> Any creature or Medium or smaller object that isn't secured to anything and that isn't being worn or carried within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can move away from the vortex by making a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. 
>
> On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until it disappears. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature concentrating on a spell when it takes this damage has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain concentration.
>
> A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to escape the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) checks to do so. If successful, the creature is no longer caught by the vortex and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a random direction.
