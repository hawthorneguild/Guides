## Aether Dreamstalker

The Aether Dreamstalker is a predator that inhabits the Region of Dreams, using the fitful sleep of those in the Material Plane to manifest a corporeal form. Aether Dreamstalkers hunt for consciousness, desiring the waking minds of mortal creatures. This forces them to hunt creatures who gather in groups where some remain awake while others rest.

Adventurers are common prey to Aether Dreamstalkers, as the common adventurer strategy of maintaining a single person on watch guarantees plenty of sleeping gates for the Dreamstalker to manifest through, and a single vulnerable target for its prey.

Once it renders a creature unconscious with its powers, a dreamstalker will begin to feed. When a dreamstalker feeds on a creature it's rendered unconscious, it devours the creature's waking mind, leaving it in a state of magical slumber from which it can't be awoken.

Over the period of a week, a dreamstalker will digest the trapped consciousness after which it's destroyed and no mortal magic can return the creature to consciousness. After a consciousness is digested, a young cub dreamstalker buds off of the parent, and begins to grow into a adult dreamstalker over the course of six months.

#### DM Notes: Devour Consciousness
- Creatures that cannot be magically put to sleep, such as elves, are immune to the Devour Consciousness trait. 
- A divine intervention can still awaken a creature whose consciousness has been digested via Devour Consciousness.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the dreamstalker moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the aether dreamstalker can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
> 
> ***Dream Manifest (1/Day).*** The dreamstalker can use a bonus action to magically shift from the Region of Dreams to the Material Plane, as long as it appears within 10 feet of a sleeping creature. When it does so, if the dreamstalker is reduced to 0 hit points while on the Material Plane, it instead is sent back to where it originally was in the Region of Dreams and regains its full hit points. A dreamstalker that has entered the Material Plane in this way can return to the Region of Dreams at any time as a bonus action.
> 
> ***Devour Consciousness.*** A dreamstalker can feed on the mind of a creature that it rendered unconscious. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, after which the victim falls under a magical slumber and can't be awoken. The victim's consciousness is trapped in the dreamstalker for 1 week, after which time it is digested. If the dreamstalker dies before the consciousness is digested, the consciousness is released and the creature awakens. A *wish* spell or divine intervention can awaken the creature, or if it's slain and returned to life. However, if the consciousness is digested, no mortal magic can awaken the slumbering creature.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dreamstalker makes two attack with its claws. If the dreamstalker is not in the Region of Dreams, it makes two attacks with its Aether Rend instead.
>
> ***Aether Rend (Outside Region of Dreams Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, the target is stable and unconscious. It remains unconscious, even after regaining hit points, until its restored to its hit point maximum.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious for one minute, or until another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Nightmare Figment.*** When a creature hits the dreamstalker with an attack, the dreamstalker can use its reaction to appear as one of the creature's nightmares. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the Dreamstalker until the end of its next turn.
