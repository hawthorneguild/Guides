> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the cartilcage remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of bones.
>
> ***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cartilcage takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.
>
> ***Rejuvenation.*** If the cartilcage is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in 1 hour unless holy water is sprinkled on its remains or a dispel magic or remove curse spell is cast on them.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The cartilcage makes two attacks with its Bind.
>
> ***Bind.*** *Melee Attack Roll*: +6, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, the cartilcage attaches to it. While attached, the cartilcage can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cartilcage can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cartilcage by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
>
> ***Chatter.*** Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 13, each creature within 60 feet of the cartilcage that can hear its chatter and that isn’t an undead. Failure: The creature becomes **frightened** until the end of the cartilcage’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cartilcage’s chatter for the next 24 hours.
