## Annums

Annums are strange, floating aberrations spawned from the dreams of an eternally hungry beholder. Born from psychic energy, these creatures feed upon dreams, leaving behind a fog tinted by the emotions they consume. Pink mist trails from pleasant dreams, while black vapor follows the nightmares they devour.

**Eaters of Millions**
Annums were spawned from the dreams of an eternally hungry beholder whose eternal hunger has been passed on to the annum itself. Because a beholder's mind remains semiconscious even as it dreams, its dreams can become warped and take on a physical form, usually becoming another beholder. In the case of these eternally hungry beholders, an annum is created instead.

Annums at first appear friendly, often luring other creatures into a false sense of security before putting them to sleep and eating their dreams. Other times, they rely on their illusion magic and stealth to lure other creatures away from their camp and consume their dreams.

**Raw Attraction**
Annum are attracted to the raw emotion that dreams produce and produce a bit of fog around themselves as they consume a dream. The color depends upon the type of dream eaten: pink for a good dream and black for a nightmare. Children's dreams attract them the most as they believe them to have the most emotion.

**Psychic Existence**
Due to the nature of an annum, they are composed almost entirely of psychic energy. Contact with one for too long can cause massive headaches and extreme paranoia. An annum appears almost translucent except for its red eyes that almost glow in the dark.
