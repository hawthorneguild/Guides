## Animated Snowman

### Origins

The original Animated Snowmen were built by a group of nomadic gnomes traveling on the High Ice to protect their settlement from marauding monsters. They are mindless protectors and will ambush anything that does not look like one of their gnomish creators.

### Behaviors

Animated Snowmen will create festive displays in order to hide in plain sight. Displays are created with snow and available foliage in the area to make circlets, necklaces, and facial expressions. If the snowmen kill a creature near their display, they will hide the body in another snowman and add it to the display. Any blood spilled will be used to add rosy cheeks, red lips, and festive stripes to elements of the display. Animated snowmen will not leave the area they were charged to protect, even if the snow melts to the point where their festive display is reduced to a ghastly display of thawing corpses and an ominous snowman remaining perfectly frozen.

### Combat Tactics

* **Step 1.** Describe happy snow scene.
* **Step 2.** If party doesn't go look, describe how some type of scavenger animals are in the area.
* **Step 3.** If the party investigates, they find a dead body inside the snowman, then get smacked by the Animated Snowman for messing up the display. 
* **Step 4.** Laugh when the monk hits it 4 times and drives the AC up real high.
* **Step 5.** Cry when someone hits it with fire.
* **Step 6.** ???
* **Step 7.** Profit.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the snowman remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal snowman.
>
> ***Cold Absorption.*** Whenever the snowman is subjected to cold damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the cold damage dealt.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The snowman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Compacted Snow.*** When the snowman is dealt bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or force damage, the outside layer of snow is compacted, making it harder to hit. The snowman gains a **+1 bonus to AC** each time it takes damage from one of these damage types, up to a maximum of AC 20. If the snowman takes fire damage, any AC bonus accumulated from this feature is lost.
>
> ### Actions
> 
> ***Multiattack.*** The snowman uses Winter's Breath if available and two slam attacks or two snowball attacks.
>
> ***Winter's Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The snowman exhales an icy blast in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
