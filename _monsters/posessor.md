## Possessor

A possessor is a type of lesser elemental formed from stray negative emotions and thoughts that have coalesced over a long period of time. It is emotionless and acts purely on instinct to survive by draining the life force of living creatures it comes across, often using its ability to possess objects to its advantage by lying in wait for unsuspecting individuals. That being said, they are quite frail in their naked forms, and thus rely on using objects of varying sizes to beat their prey into submission before moving in to safely feed.

Though they are not especially intelligent, they often gather in abandoned buildings near small settlements, lying in wait for curious individuals to investigate rumors of "the old haunted house on the hill."

***Elemental Nature.*** A possessor doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### Note
A Possessor always favors beginning combat inside an object and is likely to surprise the adventuring party given its **False Appearance** trait. Treat the possessor as a **CR 3** (700 XP) if it begins combat already possessing an object.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Life Drain.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) Necrotic damage, and the possessor heals for an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the attack hits, the possessor attaches itself to its target. While attached, the possessor doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the possessor's turns, the target takes 6 (1d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The possessor can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement or when the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the possessor.
>
> ***Object Possession.*** The possessor enters and takes control of one Large or smaller object that it can see within 5 feet not being worn or carried by another creature and animates it as per the *animate objects* spell. The possessor can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, skills, senses, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, immunity to charmed and frightened, and Born of Darkness trait. It otherwise uses the possessed object's statistics as per the *animate objects* spell, and the object gains a bonus to its attack rolls equal to the possessor's Charisma modifier (+3). The possession lasts until the object drops to 0 hit points, the possessor ends it as a bonus action, or the possessor is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the possessor reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the object.
