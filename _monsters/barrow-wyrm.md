## Barrow Wyrm

Few remember the story of how the first barrow wyrm came to be, but modern scholars say that it was the work of dubious necromancers who tried to tap into some of the more primal aspects of the Weave in order to use it for their own purposes. In doing so, they might be able to expand their influence over their undead armies and perhaps create something that posed more threat to their rivals and enemies.

However, if you were to bring that story over to someone from the witch country of Rashemen, they would dismiss it for a story of their own.

#### Primal Product of Witchcraft

Barrow wyrms were originally created by the Rashmaar (or Rashemi) witch caste with the aid of both the willing souls of retiring members of their respective communities and the heart of an adult dragon. Originally, the barrow wyrms were created in response to the growing threat from the Thayan Plateau, as red wizards were getting closer and closer to the borders. To solve this problem, the original intention was to call upon the spirits of the past to help defend their people. However, there was a serious problem. Despite the witch caste's connection with the spirits, it became apparent that spirits who had long departed cannot be used for the upcoming process because they would not be able to agree to something they had no way of knowing about.

#### One Last Hurrah

Creating a barrow wyrm starts with a party of hunters that are sent off to hunt down an adult dragon, primarily due to its magic. Each of the hunters are aware that by the end of the hunt, they will be killed during the creation of the creature. So while a party of any age of capable dragon hunter would be allowed as long as they knew of the risks, the most preferrable would be a group of retiring patriotic veterans who would likely find it distasteful to die a mundane death. The hunt for the requisite dragon would be considered complete once the barrow, to which the wyrm will get its name, is made. After which, the newly created barrow wyrm will stand guard for many years.

#### Territorial Sentinels

A barrow wyrm's territory can easily get mistaken for the lair of an actual dragon, denoted by minor regional changes based on the dragon it was created from, and the stories of barrows themselves possibly containing buried treasure, which can be mistaken for its "hoard". Some barrow wyrms can be so old that they become overgrown and can be mistaken for a regular burial mound, a knot of thick tree roots, or a small marked cave. Once provoked, or once they detect an intruder, the barrow wyrm acts according to the whims of the spirits that were used to create it. They give up their assault once the intruder is far enough away from it territory.

Depending on how they were made and who they were made from, barrow wyrms will either resort to violence upon first sight of an intruder in their territory or be willing to take
some time to study their new visitor while hidden away. Spirits generally can't learn of things that have happened past their death, so they tend to default to what they are used to
and what they see in the moment.

#### A Story Twisted

In the recent years since the Spellplague, certain practitioners of the arcane persuasion heard the stories surrounding the barrow wyrms and thought to replicate the process. However, given the resources that were needed to produce such a thing in the first place, these wizards decided to shorten the process using various necromantic arts and occasionally supplementing the heart of an adult dragon and souls of the willing with the souls of their enemies.

These "lesser" barrow wyrms were capable of serving their intended purposes as well as their original counterparts, but they lack the coherent ability to judge their surroundings properly. Another thing that lesser barrow wyrms lack is the draconic spark of magic that would normally allow them to alter their surroundings and use it to their advantage.

#### Variant: Lesser Barrow Wyrm

To run a lesser barrow wyrm, lower the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of the barrow wyrm by 6 and lower its Wisdom and Charisma saving throw bonuses and its Perception bonus by 3 accordingly. A lesser barrow wyrm retains all other statistics. A lesser barrow wyrm does not have regional effects or lair actions.

#### Variations

- To determine a barrow wyrm's regional effect upon where it is located, use the regional effects for an adult dragon corresponding with what kind of dragon was used in the creation of the wyrm. The DC is the same as its lair actions.
- If you want to run a lesser version of a barrow wyrm, forgo the regional effects, lower all mental stats by 6, and keep physical stats the same.
- Depending on how they were made and who they were made from, barrow wyrms will either resort to violence upon first sight of an intruder in their territory or be willing to take some time to study their new visitor while hidden away. Spirits generally can't learn of things that have happened past their death, so they tend to default to what they are used to and what they see in the moment.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Stalwart Cacophony.*** The barrow wyrm has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the charmed or frightened condition upon itself
>
> ***False Appearance.*** If the barrow wyrm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn’t observed the barrow wyrm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the barrow wyrm isn’t a normal burial mound.
>
> ***Magic Weapons.*** The barrow wyrm’s attacks are magical.
>
> ***Spiritual Shroud.*** The barrow wyrm can activate or deactivate this feature as a bonus action. While active, the shroud deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature of the wyrm’s choice that starts its turn within 30 feet of it. A creature that takes any of this damage has its speed reduced by 10 feet and can’t regain hit points until the start of the barrow wyrm’s next turn.
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the barrow wyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The barrow wyrm makes two Slam attacks and one Bite attack. The barrow wyrm can replace its Bite attack with its Cacophonous Scream, if available.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Cacophonous Scream (Recharge 5-6).*** The barrow wyrm lets out a wailing scream in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 42 (12d6) psychic damage, can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn, and on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.
>
> ***Detect.*** The barrow wyrm makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
>
> ***Burrowing Glide (Costs 2 Actions).*** The barrow wyrm burrows sand, earth, mud, or ice up to twice its burrow speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
>
> ### Lair Actions
>
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the wyrm takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the wyrm can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
>
> - **Grasping Roots.** Grasping roots sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within the lair that the barrow wyrm can see. For one minute, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling roots until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.
>
> - **Summon Spirits.** The spirits of the wyrm are called out in force: the barrow wyrm summons 4 (1d4+2) **sword wraith warriors** to unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the barrow wyrm that can take their turns immediately. The sword wraith warriors ignore difficult terrain created by the barrow wyrm and immediately disappear after taking their turns.
>
> - **Wall of Nature.** The barrow wyrm creates a wall of stone or plants on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5 and 30 hit points. If the wall is made from plants, it is vulnerable to fire damage, and if it is made of stone, it is vulnerable to thunder damage. Creatures can travel through the plant wall at as if it were difficult terrain. The wall disappears when the wyrm uses this lair action again or when the wyrm dies.
>
> ### Regional Effects
>
> A barrow wyrm's regional effects are the same as the corresponding adult dragon that the barrow wyrm originated from. The DC for any associated saving throws is 15.
