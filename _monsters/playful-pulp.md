> ### Traits
>
> ***Amorphous.*** The pulp can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
>
> ***Euphoric Feeding.*** As long as the pulp has a creature **grappled**, it regains 15 hit points at the start of each of its turns.
>
> ***Nimble Escape.*** The pulp can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action.
>
> ***Potently Playful.*** As a bonus action, the pulp can move up to its speed towards a creature it can see.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The pulp can make two Snatching Pseudopod attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Adorable Antics or Euphoric Tickle.
>
> ***Snatching Pseudopod.*** ***Melee Attack Roll:*** +6, reach 10 ft., one target. ***Hit:*** The target is now **grappled** (Escape DC 15) and pulled into the pulp’s space. Until this grapple ends, the creature is **restrained**, and the pulp can’t grapple another target.
>
> ***Adorable Antics.*** The pulp forces each creature that can see or hear it within 30 feet of it to succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be **charmed** by the pulp until the end of its next turn. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are immune to the pulp’s Adorable Antics for the next 12 hours.
>
> ***Euphoric Tickle.*** The pulp tickles a creature **grappled** by it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or spend its action on its next turn laughing uncontrollably. If it fails the save by 5 or more, it also falls **prone**.
