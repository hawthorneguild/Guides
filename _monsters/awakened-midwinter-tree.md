## Awakened Midwinter Tree

Midwinter is here and its that time of year when worshippers of various gods take the opportunity to pray and have rituals in their honor. Some have joyful and peaceful celebrations, while other creatures are up to something more... sinister.

Every Midwinter, a green hag named Grincheuse decorates spruce trees with beautiful ornaments before awakening them and sending them out to villages throughout the land to do her bidding.

Their beautiful garland and glass baubles are meant to attract those looking to collect fancy trinkets and serve to make the awakened midwinter trees more approachable. ''Looks can be deceiving'' has never been more true when speaking of these trees. Thanks to Grincheuse's magic, the awakened midwinter tree can use its strands of garland to restrain its prey and ensure its success in capturing it, then bringing it to its creator.

The bright light cast upon the star placed atop the tree allows the awakened midwinter trees to travel more easily in darker environments. Akin to their fancy decorations, the star serves as a lure to attract the curious passersby who would be tempted to inquire about the shining light in the distance.

Grincheuse is said to use the trees to capture villagers, notably children, during the time of Midwinter, hence the name ''awakened midwinter tree''. Rumors say she does so out of pure cruelty and desire to ruin the villagers happiness. Winter being harsh and cold, it is displeasing to her some could find warmth and joy in their hearts during that time. Those are only speculations, for no one was ever known to return from her clutches.

#### Combat Tactics
The main goal of the tree is to capture people and return them to their creator. It will:
• Target the easiest prey to grapple and drag away and hit them with a garland attack twice.
• If both attacks hit the tree use their engulf ability.
• Once it has something captured it will attempt to flee home while attacking anything that is hostile towards it.
• It will use its Winter Balls attack to try to aid its cause by spreading glass everywhere between it and its opponents making it more difficult to chase after it.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Blinding Star.*** When a creature that can see the tree's star starts its turn within 30 feet of the tree, the tree can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the tree isn't **incapacitated** and can see the creature. If the creature fails the save it is **blinded** until the end of its next turn. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the tree until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the tree in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the tree remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The tree makes two **Garland Swipe** attacks and one **Winter Balls** attack. If both **Garland Swipe** attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is **grappled** (escape DC 14), and the tree uses its **Engulf** on it.
>
> ***Garland Swipe.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Winter Balls.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +5, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) Piercing damage. On a hit, the area within 5 ft. of the target becomes difficult terrain and any creature ending its turn in it takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Engulf.*** The tree engulfs a Medium or smaller creature **grappled** by it. The engulfed target is **blinded**, **restrained**, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the tree's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the tree moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The tree can have only one creature engulfed at a time. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the tree.
