## The Bitter Maiden

> *The lone traveler came across a strange sight that night. The visage of a woman dressed in warm furs and a white gown upon her slender frame was standing just over a bridge. A white porcelain mask was the only thing seen of her face as the cold storm picks up around him, the sound of tearful weeping accompanies him as he succumbs to a biting cold.*

## The Bitter Maiden
Wearing a decorated mask resembling their once-glowing faces, the Bitter Maiden is a mournful spirit whose feelings of melancholy have caused it to come back to the living world in order to try to fill the holes left in them in life. Whether or not that is physically or metaphorically is largely up to interpretation.

**Inhabitor of a Former Visage**. A Bitter Maiden often takes the form of whoever they were before their eventual demise in life, albeit their body is in the state of death reminiscent of their final moments. Like their title suggests, a Bitter Maiden is most likely found around the place where they died, wearing a porcelain mask decorated in funerary offerings in order to hide the hideous truth beneath.

**Predators in Winter**. Lonely souls that find themselves in the midst of a storm or traveling about on cold nights will also find themselves catching the eyes of the Bitter Maiden. Driven by a want of some kind of warmth in death, the maiden will approach these individuals and will eventually consume them after the initial kill. The Bitter Maiden's targets tend to be lone travelers, individuals who have recently experienced emotional loss, and orphans.

If a bitter maiden encounters another of its kind, their greedy nature will cause them to fight with one another over who gets claim over the prey before them.

**Mask of the Dead**. The mask that the Bitter Maiden wears is merely to hide the hideousness of its undead nature. Though it might mimic the sounds and mannerism of the person it is supposed to be, the bitter maiden will not take off its mask nor allow anyone else to touch it. When the mask is removed, all that is left underneath is a feral malicious husk filled with decay.

When its mask is removed, the bitter maiden can no longer keep up its guise and will fly into a rage to get it back, believing itself to not be undead. The bitter maiden under the mask is a pitiful creature of envy, greed, and emptiness. Some would even call it one of the evils of winter. It is attracted to sights of warmth and happiness, something it cannot have and will no longer be able to get.

**Undead Nature**. A bitter maiden doesn't require air, food,

#### Combat Tactics

> Before combat, Bitter Maidens will never try to actively go after the party unless they pose a problem and put themselves between them and their target. They will watch and remain within eyeshot, especially with their Aura of Bitter Winter active around them until it is the perfect time to strike. In combat, the maiden will use their Bitter Hoarfrost on the first turn before using their bonus action to turn on their aura. They will then take advantage of their vision through the aura and move over to the back line to pick on anyone who looks most vulnerable and squishy with an Icy Glare then a Life Drain.

> **Toria's Advice**. Never actually use one of these to torture your players with loss unless you know the characters enough.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aura of Bitter Winter.*** The maiden can activate or deactivate this feature as a bonus action. While active, the aura causes the area within 30 feet of the maiden to become **heavily obscured**. The maiden ignores this effect and can see normally.
>
> ***Mask of the Dead.*** The maiden wears a funerary mask upon its face to hide its undead nature. While the maiden is wearing the mask, it is immune to magic that would detect it as an undead creature. The mask can be removed with a contested Strength (Athletics) check. The maiden will lose all benefits this mask gives it upon taking it off.
>
> ***Mimicry (When Wearing the Mask of the Dead).*** The maiden can mimic the voice of a deceased creature it has taken the form of. A creature that hears the voice can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The maiden uses its **Icy Glare** and makes a **Life Drain** attack.
>
> ***Icy Glare.*** The maiden targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is **paralyzed** until the end of the maiden's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is **frightened** of the maiden for 1 minute. The **frightened** target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the maiden, ending the **frightened** condition on itself on a success.
>
> ***Life Drain.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) Necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ***Bitter Hoarfrost (Recharge 5-6).*** The maiden throws out a spray of ice and freezing cold in a 30 foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) Cold damage and have disadvantage on all ability checks until the end of the affected creature's turn.
