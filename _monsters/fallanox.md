> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the fallanox remains motionless, it appears to be a large dead spider and appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The fallanox has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the fallanox's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Spider Climb.*** The fallanox can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>
> ***Two Heads.*** The fallanox has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
>
> ***Wakeful.*** When one of the fallanox's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.
>
> ***Web Walker.*** The fallanox ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Fallanox makes two Bite attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) Piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) Poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** for 1 minute. The target is **paralyzed** while poisoned in this way. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points.
>
> ***Web (Recharge 6).*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +6, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is **restrained** by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***False Death (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the fallanox takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead and appears to die, unless the damage is from a critical hit.
