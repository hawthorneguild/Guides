## Cauchemar

Nothing lasts forever, and the formations that arise in the Region of Dreams are especially ephemeral. When a desert can change to an ocean as quick as a thought, one could almost abandon the concept of permanence altogether.

Nevertheless, when a dreamscape discorporates into undifferentiated dream-stuff, it is possible for a small part to coagulate together into something more resilient and stable. Of course, without any external stimulus, even these forms are prone to breaking apart at a moment's notice.

Occasionally, however, a denizen of the Region of Dreams will gather together a curated selection of these dream-stuff fragments. By combining solidified parts chosen from dreams (or dreamers) sharing similar qualities, it is possible to create something greater than the sum of its parts: a sapient consciousness consisting entirely of dream-stuff.

#### Living Nightmares

A **cauchemar** is a creature composed of dream-stuff harvested from the dreams of the hateful, the selfish, and the cruel. Typically, it is created with the intent of using it as a servant or something akin to a pet; this goal rarely comes to fruition, as a cauchemar is an intelligent creature, and resents being beholden to another's orders.

Left to its own devices, a cauchemar wanders the Region of Dreams, searching for unsuspecting dreamers to terrorize. Luckily for the dreamers in question, this behaviour has no ramifications for a physical body, so long as the cauchemar stays within the Region of Dreams. This matters to the cauchemar little: traumatizing dreamers is, after all, its own reward.

#### Psychic Leeches
Though not capable of freely travelling between the planes, cauchemars can be transported by others. Outside the Region of Dreams, a cauchemar is faced with a unique challenge posed by its inherently unstable biology. Dream-stuff is as rigid as a sand dune, and a creature composed of dream-stuff is at perpetual risk of fading into nothingness without a constant supply.

Fortunately for the cauchemar, leaving its home plane is not an automatic death sentence. A cauchemar can keep itself stable by feeding off the psyches of others. It is alarmingly well-adapted to feeding in this manner. A lapse as simple as forgetting the location of one's keys can be all the opening a cauchemar needs to leech energy away from a nearby creature. Indeed, entire households have perished from this, withering away with dementia-like symptoms as an unnoticed cauchemar assaulted their waking and sleeping minds.

#### Unusual Nature
The cauchemar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. However, if outside the Region of Dreams, it requires a consistent diet of mental energy from hapless victims for sustenance. To gain the benefits of a long rest, it must either spend the entire rest in the Region of Dreams or have gained temporary hit points using its **Pernicious Feeding** trait in the past 24 hours.

For every 24 hours the cauchemar goes without benefiting from a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 levels of exhaustion.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Amorphous.*** The cauchemar can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The cauchemar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cauchemar's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: *color spray*, *mind sliver*, *sleep* > 3/day each: *hallucinatory terrain*, *phantasmal force* > 1/day each: *dream*, *major image* (as a 6th-level spell)
>
> ***Pernicious Feeding.*** If a fey or humanoid within 30 feet of the cauchemar fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, the target takes 8 (1d6 + 5) psychic damage. The cauchemar regains a number of hit points equal to the psychic damage taken. If the cauchemar already has all its hit points when it deals damage with this trait, it instead gains temporary hit points equal to half the psychic damage taken.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The cauchemar attacks three times with its disorient. It can replace one of these attacks by casting a spell it is capable of innately casting at will.
>
> ***Disorient.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) psychic damage, and the target has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws until the end of the cauchemar's next turn. Furthermore, until the end of the cauchemar's next turn, the target is treated as if it has half as many hit points for the purpose of enchantment and illusion spells (such as *color spray* and *sleep*) that can target only a certain number of hit points' worth of creatures.
