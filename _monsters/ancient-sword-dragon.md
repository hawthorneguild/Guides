## Ancient Sword Dragon

Sword dragons are powerful and exceedingly rare variants of dragons, born from hoarding vast quantities of magical swords. These dragons don’t share their parents’ usual traits and are often abandoned after displaying an appetite for consuming enchanted weaponry.

**Sharp Appearance.** A sword dragon’s body appears forged from countless bladed weapons, with scales resembling sharpened daggers that lengthen as the creature ages. Their scales evolve from heavy iron in wyrmlings, to tempered steel in young dragons, to lightweight mithral in adults, and finally hardened adamantine in ancients. Magical consumption grants them formidable new abilities, making them truly epic foes.

### Customizing a Sword Dragon

To customize a sword dragon, start with the base stat block for its age category (wyrmling, young, adult, or ancient). Then, roll once on each previous age category’s table to add traits, beginning from wyrmling up to its current age.  

If a trait doesn’t specify a saving throw DC, use the dragon’s breath weapon DC.

#### Sword Dragon Wyrmling Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |
|:--:|:------------|:-------------|
| 1 | **Alert** | The dragon has advantage on initiative rolls, and neither it nor its allies within 30 ft. can be surprised. |
| 2 | **Dominating** | The dragon can cast *command* and *dominate beast* at will via Innate Spellcasting. |
| 3 | **Vengeful** | The dragon can use its reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that damaged it. |
| 4 | **Wrathful** | When the dragon hits a target, creatures of its choice within 5 ft. of that target take 5 (2d4) slashing damage. |

#### Young Sword Dragon Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |
|:--:|:------------|:-------------|
| 1 | **Baneful** | The dragon has advantage on attack rolls against a chosen kind of creature, which also has disadvantage on saving throws against the dragon’s breath weapon. |
| 2 | **Draining** | Once per turn, the dragon deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains that many temporary hit points. |
| 3 | **Metamorphic** | The dragon can use a bonus action to gain resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning until it changes again. Its attacks and breath weapon match this damage type. |
| 4 | **Vicious** | On a critical hit, the dragon rolls damage dice three times instead of twice. |

#### Adult Sword Dragon Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |

| 2 | **Sharpened** | When the dragon reduces a creature to 0 HP, it severs a limb or portion of the creature’s body. |
| 3 | **Slaying** | When the dragon hits a creature with 100 HP or fewer, it can force a DC 15 Constitution save or the creature dies instantly. |
| 4 | **Swift** | The dragon can make one extra attack as a bonus action each turn. |

#### Ancient Sword Dragon Traits

>
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - 1d4 + 1 of the dragon's scales detach to defend the dragon. The scales have the statistics of flying swords and act on initiative count 20. The constructs last for 1 minute, after which they become inanimate once again.
> - The dragon's scales become primed with magical energy.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each time the dragon takes 10 or more damage, its scales burst out and each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage.
> - A swirling cloud of swords forms 10 feet around the dragon, which follows the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. The cloud provides the dragon with three-quarters cover, and the area 10 feet around the dragon becomes difficult terrain for other creatures.  When a creature enters the cloud's area for the first time
> on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
>
> ### Regional Effects
>
> The region containing a legendary sword dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
> - Grass and plants within 6 miles of the lair are razor sharp and hazardous to outsiders. The area covered by the vegetation is difficult terrain, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
> - Protrusions of earth and stone within 6 miles of the dragon's lair form into blade-like shapes. Any rock formations may resemble oversized swords.
> - Knives on occasion rain from the sky within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. Creatures caught in the rain take 1 piercing damage each turn until they can find shelter.
> - Whirling blades scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A whirling blade has the statistics of an air elemental, it has a speed of 50 feet, it has an Intelligence and - Charisma of 1 (-5), and its damage rolls deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
> - Blades brought within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sharpen themselves and never dull while they remain in the area.
> - The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any magical, bladed weapon within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.
> If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.
