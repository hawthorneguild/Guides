## Autumn Gremlin

Gremlins of the Autumn Court are called upon when their masters need a creepy and crawly creature to ambush a nuisance to the Court. They are larger, stronger and more intimidating than their smaller boggle cousins. It is rumoured that boggles that achieve great service to the Court are transformed into these beings. The transformation renders them blind, and they learn to lurk in dark caves and scurry their way through the earth.

**Earth Shapers**
All autumn gremlins can burrow fast through the ground. On top of this, they can seemingly create tunnels with mere thoughts and even transport mounds of dirt and rock from the ground into the air in order to crush their enemies.

**Tricksters and Assassins**
The Gremlins are by nature mischevious, but they can often turn to maliciousness. When left to their own devices, they will often play increasingly cruel tricks on their victims. At first, things will go missing, then animals in the area will begin to seem skittish as the autumn gremlins prod them through tunnels. Eventually, whole communities will go missing with the only thing left being upturned earth in the last place they were seen.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Gremlin Swarm.*** The autumn gremlin has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one other gremlin is within 5 feet of the creature and that gremlin isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Stone Camouflage.*** The autumn gremlin has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when in rocky terrain.
>
> ***Scurry.*** As a bonus action, the autumn gremlin can create an invisible and immobile rift provided that the rift is no bigger than 10 feet on any side and is on dirt, unworked stone or other natural terrain it can see within 5 feet of it. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the gremlin can see or specify by distance and direction. While next to the rift, the autumn gremlin can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the gremlin puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the autumn gremlin can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the gremlin's next turn.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The autumn gremlin makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Greataxe, or two with its Darts.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Dart.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +6, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 4) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Greataxe.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d12 + 3) Slashing damage.
>
> ***Cave In.*** The autumn gremlin hits the ground in front of it, causing it to collapse. A Medium or smaller creature of the autumn gremlin’s choice standing on loose earth or unworked stone within 5 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls into a hole 5 feet long on each side and 5 feet deep, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage, and is **restrained** by the collapsed earth on top of it. The **restrained** creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check in order to escape. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, does not fall into the hole and is not **restrained**. The autumn gremlin cannot affect a creature already under the effects of and **restrained** by Cave In.
>
> ***Dust Cloud (Recharge 5 - 6).*** The autumn gremlin kicks up loose dirt, gravel, mud, or similar terrain around it into the eyes of its opponents. Each creature within 10 feet of the autumn gremlin must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be **blinded** until the end of the autumn gremlin’s next turn.
