> ### Traits
>
> ***Adhesive (Object Form Only).*** The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also **grappled** by it (escape DC 16). Ability Checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
>
> ***Extradimensional Storage.*** The mimic's mouth has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter wide and 4 feet deep. This space can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. A creature can use a bonus action to retrieve an item from this space.
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** The mimic can use its action to polymorph into an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
>
> ***False Appearance (Object Form Only).*** While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
>
> ***Grappler.*** The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature **grappled** by it.
>
> ### Actions
