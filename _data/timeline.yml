      The gnolls Mongrel and Gnarl seek to break out Rendhowl, a gnoll of Mongrel's pack that had been imprisoned after committing assault. The pair travel across the town, stealing a massive supply of explosives from Arx, goblin archaelologist and grenadier. The pair escape into the sewers, with Councilwoman Tasuk'suva tailing them and managing to stop Gnarl. Mongrel enters Mulmaster Yard from the sewers with the aim of freeing Rendhowl and fights his way to the common room, where he explodes the bombs. All individuals in the area perish except for the adventurer Tenzin, who is shielded by the dragonborn paladin Ghehadur at the cost of his life. In the wake of the devastating incident, security across Mulmaster Yard and the guild as a whole is increased.
