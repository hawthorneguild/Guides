Beneath the surface of the earth run streams and currents of magical energy. This energy sometimes forms into nexuses that can create a number of magical effects and whose powers can be harnessed. These nexuses are known as **earth nodes**.

This document provides information regarding earth nodes (as well as other kinds of nodes) that exist throughout the world and whose powers can be harnessed by both heroes and villains alike. 

For DMs, this document presents an optional ruleset and detailed mechanics for those wishing to incorporate such nodes into their storylines in appropriate adventure locations. The information is presented to provide a detailed set of guidelines and mechanics by which to utilize earth nodes in your storylines while also leaving freedom to customize or tailor earth nodes as they may pertain to your specific stories.

For players, this document presents information regarding earth nodes as you may encounter them in the adventures your characters undergo, should your DM choose to utilize the content in this document. The information here can be referenced by players for interactions involving earth nodes in game sessions, as well as with respect to the Node Spellcasting and Node Manifestation Supernatural Gifts that can be acquired by player characters. 

This document describes a variety of mechanics associated with earth nodes, including their use in adventures and in downtime. A player character can **only** interact with and utilize the properties of an earth node in an adventure or during downtime given the permission of and as supervised by the DM that is utilizing the earth node in their storylines.


## Features of Earth Nodes

Beneath the earth, pools, and streams of invisible power sometimes collect and cross into a single location, creating an underground nexus of magical energy. Such areas are known as **earth nodes**. An earth node is not by itself visible to ordinary sight, but earth nodes are often located in places that are beautiful or bizarre. As an example, a large geode or an underground cavern in the Underdark might contain an earth node within it, but such sights aren't always present. 

The power of an earth node isn't limited by physical boundaries. Some earth nodes lie within large underground caverns, while others exist entirely within solid rock. Still other earth nodes may have a portion that lies within a cave or tunnel, while the rest extends into stone. Some earth nodes may extend partly or even fully into the surface above. 

## Properties of Earth Nodes

Earth nodes come in different levels of strength and extent as indicated by their class. The higher a given earth node's class, the more powerful the earth node is. The majority of earth nodes fall between class 1 and class 5, as weaker earth nodes are more common. It is believed that half of all earth nodes are class 1, one-quarter are class 2, and the majority of the remainder are class 3 or class 4.

Earth nodes of class 2 or higher consist of multiple nested circular layers, with a number of layers equal to the class of the earth node. For example, a class 1 earth node has only a single layer, whereas a class 3 earth node has 3 distinct layers. Each layer of the earth node has its own individual class rating, with the innermost layer having the highest rating equal to the class rating of the earth node as a whole, and each layer beyond it having a class rating as one less than the layer before. For example, a class 3 earth node has an inner layer with a class rating of 3, a middle layer with a class rating of 2, and an outer layer with a class rating of 1.

The power of an earth node can enhance spellcasting and create other magical effects. A creature that is aware of an earth node can attempt to utilize its powers, but the process of doing so requires effort. Creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gifts have developed a heightened sense and ability for utilizing earth nodes, as detailed on the following pages.

The table below describes various associated properties of an earth node.

#### *Typical Earth Nodes Properties Based On Class*

## Sensing Earth Nodes

Earth nodes themselves are invisible to ordinary perception, but they can be detected as a sense of magic in the area. Any creature that approaches within 30 feet of an earth node or that enters the area can make a passive or active check (DC 15) as described below to notice the earth node and to recognize it as an earth node. 

* **Non-Spellcasters** make an Intelligence check.
* **Spellcasters** make an ability check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Spellcasters with the Node Spellcasting Supernatural Gift** make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Mystics** make an Intelligence check.
* **Mystics with the Node Manifestation Supernatural Gift** make an Intelligence (Arcana) check.

A creature using the *detect magic* spell automatically detects and recognizes an earth node within the spell's range.

A creature that senses an earth node in this way is able to map out the earth node's boundaries. The process requires time as it takes travel and observation to map out the boundaries of an earth node. As a guideline, without factoring in additional time due to physical barriers or other obstacles, it takes 10 minutes to map out the inner layer of an earth node. Each layer beyond the inner layer takes an additional 10 minutes for each layer before it.

For example, a class 3 earth node has 3 layers: an inner, middle, and outer layer. It takes 10 minutes to map out the inner layer, 20 minutes to map out the middle layer, and 30 minutes to map out the outer layer. In total, it would take at least one hour to map out a class 3 earth node. 

The *commune with nature* spell can also be used to locate (but not map out) any earth nodes within the spell's range.

## Studying Earth Nodes

Utilizing some of the powers associated with an earth node requires one to spend time and effort in study of a particular earth node and learning its specific pattern of magical energy. This can occur in the following two ways:

* A creature that is aware of a given earth node can become **proficient** in their understanding of that earth node's pattern of magical energy by spending a short rest within the area while studying its pattern of magical energy. At the end of the short rest, the creature can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the node DC of the earth node. On a success, the creature commits the earth node to memory as if it were the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle.
* A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift that is also **proficient** in their understanding of a specific earth node's pattern of magical energy can additionally acquire **expertise** in their understanding of that earth node's pattern of magical energy. The creature can study the energies of a given earth node for a number of workweeks of downtime while in the area of the earth node, spending at least 8 hours each day engaged in the activity. At the end of each workweek, the creature must make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node. The creature must acquire a number of total successes in this way equal to the earth node's class rating. Each failure on this check reduces the number of accumulated successes by 1, but cannot reduce it below zero. For example, studying a class 3 earth node in this way requires 3 successful Arcana checks over a minimum of 3 workweeks but could require more if failures occur.

## Powers of Earth Nodes

Earth nodes are nexuses of magical energy, enhancing spellcasting and creating other magical effects. Those aware of an earth node are capable of taking advantage of its powers and capabilities. 

Certain powers can be accessed only by those practiced and experienced in utilizing the powers of an earth node, which are individuals with the **Node Spellcasting** and/or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift. Powers which are restricted in this way are indicated below.

### Enhanced Spellcasting

A creature that is aware of a given earth node while within its area can utilize it to enhance their own spellcasting. 

When casting a spell whilst in the area of a layer of a given earth node, a creature can make a check against the node DC of that earth node layer as part of the action of casting the spell.

* **Non-Spellcasters** make an Intelligence check.
* **Spellcasters** make an ability check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Spellcasters with the Node Spellcasting Supernatural Gift** make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability.

On a success, the spell that is cast is treated as if it was cast at a number of levels higher equal to half the class rating of the earth node layer, rounded up. Spells cast at a higher level in this way still cannot be cast above 9th-level.

For example, a creature that casts a 1st-level *magic missile* spell while within an earth node layer with a class rating of 3 that succeeds on the associated check against the node DC of 18 casts the spell as if it had been cast at two levels higher, thus casting the spell at 3rd-level. 

A creature may additionally choose to use less of the earth node's power for a given earth node layer if they wish to, treating as if the creature was attempting the ability check against a node DC for a layer of a lower class rating of their choice and thereby cast the spell at a number of levels higher equal to half that class rating, rounded up.

For example, a creature that casts a 1st-level *magic missile* spell while within an earth node layer with a class rating of 3 can choose to make the ability check against the node DC of an earth node layer with a class rating of 2 (node DC 16). On a success, the creature's 1st-level *magic missile* would be treated as if it had been cast one level higher, casting the spell at 2nd-level. 

<table border=1><tr><th>Mystics</th></tr>

<tr><td>A creature with levels in the Mystic class that is aware of an earth node can use an action to gain a number of special psi points as if they had used their Psionic Mastery feature. (This does not count against the number of uses granted by their Psionic Mastery class feature.) The pool of psi points gained from this action is equal to 8 + the class rating of the earth node. 

A creature that uses this action can't do so again until 24 hours pass, and an earth node can grant this benefit up to a number of creatures equal to its class rating per day.

A mystic with the <b>Node Manifestation</b> Supernatural Gift can instead use this action twice per day.</td></tr></table>

### Magical Travel

Earth nodes can be utilized for purposes of magical travel to other locations, via the creation of portals to or from a given earth node.

#### *Teleporting to a Known Earth Node*

An earth node can be used as if it were a permanent teleportation circle as described by the *teleportation circle* spell. A creature that is **proficient** in their understanding of a specific earth node can use *teleportation circle* or similar magic to teleport within 5 feet of the origin point of the earth node, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. 

#### *Teleporting to Other Earth Nodes*

Earth nodes can also be utilized to travel to other nearby earth nodes, even those one has not yet visited. After a creature becomes **proficient** in their understanding of a given earth node, a creature able to cast the *teleportation circle* spell can use it within the area of an earth node to attempt to create a portal to a nearby earth node.

The specific earth node the portal leads to is determined by the DM. Some earth nodes are magically linked to a single earth node, whereas other earth nodes may randomly lead to any given other nearby earth node. As a general rule, the portal is linked to another earth node that is no farther from the original earth node than a number of miles equal to 100 x the class rating of the original earth node. If there are no such earth nodes nearby in range, nothing happens and the spell slot is wasted. For example, if using *teleportation circle* to create a portal from a class 3 earth node to a nearby earth node, one would arrive at an earth node no farther than 300 miles away from the original earth node.

#### *Portals to Other Locations (Restricted)*

This power can **only** be used by creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift. Earth nodes can also be used to travel to other locations on the same plane of existence. A creature that has **expertise** in their understanding of a specific earth node can use *teleportation circle*, *teleport*, or similar magic while within the area of an earth node to attempt to create a two-way portal to another location of the same plane of existence. 

Instead of the normal effect associated with using such magic, a portal is created, with a diameter in feet equal to 10 x half the class rating of the earth node (rounded up), and that lasts for a number of minutes equal to 2 x the class rating of the earth node - 1.  For example, a class 3 earth node can create a portal with a diameter of 20 feet and that lasts 5 minutes.

The portal has a front and back on each location it appears, with travel through the portal only possible through the front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other location, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. The portal is linked to a destination that is no farther from the original earth node than a number of miles equal to 200 x the class rating of the original earth node - 100. For example, a class 3 earth node can be used to create portals to destinations as far as 500 miles away.

If one attempts to create a portal in this way to a destination outside of this range, nothing happens and the magic and any associated spell slot is wasted. The creature's familiarity with the destination determines whether the portal successfully links to the intended destination. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table associated with the *teleport* spell. In the case of a Mishap, things crossing through the portal are affected by the Mishap on an individual basis. It is possible in this way for things to become separated if some ultimately end up on target, others off target, or others in a similar area as a result of the Mishap.

#### *Portals to Other Planes of Existence*

Certain earth nodes are charged with the energies of other planes of existence, allowing for the creation of portals that lead to them. Such portals lead to a fixed location on another plane of existence, most commonly in the Feywild or in the Inner Planes. After a creature becomes **proficient** in their understanding of a given earth node, a creature can also discover what plane of existence the earth node is linked to, if any. After determining this information, a creature can use *gate*, *plane shift*, or similar magic while within the area of an earth node to create a portal to another plane of existence that the earth node is tied to.

The portal that is created is similar to portals to other locations as previously above, except that it links to a specific fixed location on another plane of existence as determined by the DM. Using the *plane shift* spell in this way does not require the spell's material component.

### Granted Spells (Restricted)

This power can **only** be used by creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift. Earth nodes resonate with magical energy and are capable of allowing those sensitive to node magic to access their power to cast a variety of spells. Earth nodes can grant a number of spells equal to their class rating, with a maximum spell level equal to its class rating and one spell per spell level in this way. Each earth node grants a specific list of spells in this way as determined by the DM.

A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift that is aware of a given earth node can spend a short rest within the area bringing themselves in tune with the magical energy of the earth node. 

(This can be the same short rest spent becoming **proficient** in one's understanding of that earth node.) At the end of the short rest, the creature can make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node. 

On a success, the creature can cast the associated spells from the earth node using any spell slots of the appropriate level they have and using their spellcasting ability to do so; the creature can cast these spells in this way for the next 24 hours while they remain within the area of the earth node. On a failure, the creature is unable to cast these additional spells this way and cannot attempt to gain access to these spells again until 24 hours pass. The table below shows some typical spells that an earth node may grant as an example, though each individual earth node grants its own individual spells as determined by the DM.

***Sample Earth Node Spells***

<table style="text-align:center;" border=1>

<tr><th>Earth Node Class /<br> Maximum Spell Level</th><th>Example Spell</th></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>earth tremor</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>earthbind</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>erupting earth</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>stoneskin</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>wall of stone</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>move earth</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td>reverse gravity</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>earthquake</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>meteor swarm</td></tr></table>

A creature with levels in the Mystic class can still gain access to the spells granted by an earth node. A mystic with the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift can instead make an Intelligence (Arcana) check at the end of the short rest spent attempting to gain access to the granted spells of an earth node. The mystic can cast these spells (using no components) for the next 24 hours and while within the area using psi points up to their psi limit as detailed in the table below, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. The mystic can benefit from the Enhanced Spellcasting property when casting these spells, making Intelligence (Arcana) checks to do so.

#### *Mystic Psi Points Consumed Per Spell Level*

<table style="text-align:center;" border=1>

<tr><th>Spell Level of Granted Spell </th><th>Psi Points Required to Cast</th></tr>

<tr><td>1st</td><td>2 psi points</td></tr>

<tr><td>2nd</td><td>3 psi points</td></tr>

<tr><td>3rd</td><td>5 psi points</td></tr>

<tr><td>4th</td><td>6 psi points</td></tr>

<tr><td>5th</td><td>7 psi points</td></tr></table>

### Storing Items (Restricted)

This power can **only** be used by creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift. A creature skilled in the use of earth nodes can utilize them to store or retrieve objects within a hidden extradimensional space linked to a given earth node. An earth node can store any number of objects in this extradimensional space whose combined total volume does not exceed a number of cubic feet equal to 10 x (the earth node's class)<sup>2</sup>. No objects can be stored in an earth node in excess of its storage capacity. For example, a class 3 earth node can store up to 90 cubic feet worth of objects.

After a creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift becomes **proficient** in their understanding of that earth node, the creature can use an action while in the area to discover how much total volume worth of objects is held within the earth node at the time. The creature does not learn the specific contents of the earth node, except for any objects the creature themselves had previously stored in it.

After becoming **proficient** in their understanding of the earth node, the creature can attempt to store an object within an earth node by using an action to make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node while they and the item are in the area of an earth node. On a success, the object is stored within the extradimensional space linked to the earth node and vanishes. On a failure, nothing happens and the creature can't attempt to store that object again within that earth node until 24 hours pass. 

A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift that has stored items within an earth node can retrieve them from *any* earth node on the same plane of existence, not just the one where the item was originally stored. To do so, the creature can make an Arcana check as an action using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the original earth node where the item was stored, while within the area of an earth node on the same plane of existence as the original earth node. On a success, the object harmlessly appears in the nearest unoccupied space by the creature.

Provided that they've become **proficient** in their understanding of a given earth node, a creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift can also retrieve items within that earth node that was stored by another creature. To retrieve an object that was stored in an earth node by another, the creature must make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability while within the area of the earth node. The DC of the ability check is equal to the node DC of the earth node + the proficiency bonus of the creature who originally stored the object. (In the case multiple creatures had stored objects in a given earth node, the specific creature whose items are being retrieved is randomly determined.) On a success, a random object stored by the original creature within the earth node harmlessly appears in the nearest unoccupied space by the creature who succeeded on the ability check.

A creature with levels in the Mystic class and the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift can also store or retrieve objects from an earth node as described above. Such a mystic instead makes Intelligence (Arcana) checks to do so.

### *Node Locking (Restricted)*

This power can only be used by creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift. A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift that has **expertise** in their understanding of a specific earth node is capable of warding that earth node against its use by other creatures. The creature can use the *arcane lock* spell targeting the earth node while in its area to attempt to magically secure it. Instead of the normal effect of the spell, *arcane lock* cast in this way magically "locks" the node by increasing the effective node DC of the earth node by 10 for any other creature that interacts with the earth node. Creatures can be additionally designated when casting *arcane lock* in this way to be able to interact with the earth node normally. 

This "node lock" can only be removed by means of a *dispel magic* spell in the area of the earth node, targeting a magical effect as if attempting to dispel a spell of the same level as the class rating of the earth node. For example, attempting use the *dispel magic* spell on a node lock present in a class 4 earth node would be treated as if trying to dispel a 4th-level spell.

## Modifying Earth Nodes


<div class="image-text-wrapper">
  <div class="hierarchy-explanation" style="flex: 1; min-width: 0;">
    The area around an earth node can be modified, from incorporating an earth node into a structure to opening up an earth node that resides within solid rock. However, such modifications to the area may affect the integrity of the earth node situated within it.<br>

    Any physical project involving building around or modifying the area around an earth node takes the normal amount of time to accomplish such a project, as determined by the DM. However, ensuring that the earth node remains intact throughout this process requires supervision by a creature familiar with the earth node.<br><br>

    In the event that the project makes either no or at most minor modifications to the area in which the earth node is situated, then the earth node is unaffected by the project. However, projects which involve moderate or extensive changes to the area risk damaging the earth node.<br><br>

    At the end of each workweek associated with the project, a creature that has become <b>proficient</b> in their understanding of a given earth node can make an ability check using their spellcasting ability while within the area of that earth node. A creature with the <b>Node Spellcasting</b> Supernatural Gift can instead make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability, and a creature with the <b>Node Manifestation</b> Supernatural Gift can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. (A creature without a spellcasting ability instead makes an Intelligence check.) A creature proficient in mason's tools that is also overseeing the project can provide Help on the ability check. <br><br>

    The DC of the ability check is equal to the node DC if the project involves moderate changes to the area as determined by the DM. If the project involves extensive changes to the area as determined by the DM, the DC for the ability check is equal to the node DC + 5.<br><br>

    On a success, the creature is able to help reroute and smooth the flow of magical energy in the new physical arrangement as associated with the project. On a failure, the class rating of the earth node decreases by 1. An earth node whose class rating is reduced to 0 is destroyed.<br><br> 

    If projects involving moderate or extensive changes aren't supervised, there is a cumulative 5% chance for each day of the project that the class rating of the node is reduced by 1. This chance resets to 5% after the node's class rating is reduced, before accumulating with each day once more.<br><br>

    </div>

<span class="image-caption">Image: A Wizard summons the power of an earth node, Forgotten Realms Underdark</span>

It is possible for an earth node to naturally repair itself over time, with a typical rate that a layer is regained after a number of years equal to 2 x (the earth node's current class rating). For example, a class 3 earth node that was damaged down to class 1 takes 2 years to return to class 2 and another 4 years to return to class 3.  This process can sometimes proceed more rapidly or be magically assisted, as determined by the DM.

In the case of the earth node's destruction, it typically reconstitutes itself as a class 1 earth node within 1 mile of the original node after 2d10 days.
  


## Creating Earth Nodes

The following section is intended to provide background information and guidelines for DMs looking to incorporate artificially created earth nodes as part of their storylines and is not intended to allow for the creation of artificial earth nodes by player characters. 

While earth nodes are typically natural phenomena, it is possible through means of powerful and esoteric magic to artificially create the nexus of magical energy that comprises an earth node. The creation of an artificial earth node requires powerful magic, on par with that of 9th-level spells, as well as the knowledge and skill by which to utilize the magic of nodes. 

The specific methods or magic by which an earth node can be artificially created varies. Certain artifacts, such as the fabled *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*, are believed to have the capacity by which they could potentially be used by a creature skilled in node magic to forge an artificial earth node. Additionally, spellcasters capable of casting 9th-level spells may be able to conduct various rituals or the use of certain powerful magics by which to create an earth node. Finally, certain powerful supernatural creatures, such as some dragons or genies, have innate magical abilities to artificially create and cultivate earth nodes. A specific method by which to create an earth node is often a closely guarded secret and is difficult to acquire. Regardless of the method, only creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift are capable of creating an earth node at all, and earth nodes can generally only be created in areas that are at least partially if not wholly underground. (Any DM may modify a monster's statblock to include the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift to accommodate this, as detailed on page 12.)

The following describes the most common procedure by which a spellcaster with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift and the ability to cast 9th-level spells can utilize, known as the *Node Genesis* ritual. After learning of and internalizing the ritual, the spellcaster must stand at the intended origin point of the node to be created and conduct a ritual (requiring concentration as if concentrating on a spell) over the course of 8 uninterrupted hours, expending a 9th-level spell slot and at least 500 GP worth of adamantine in doing so. This ritual must be repeated for a full tenday in total, consuming the same material components (for a total of 5,000 GP worth of adamantine) and a 9th-level spell slot for each day. At the end of the process, a class 1 earth node is created at the location.

The earth node slowly grows in size and strength over time, with a new layer added after a number of years equal to 2 x (the earth node's current class rating), up to that of a class 5 earth node. For example, it would take a class 1 earth node 2 years to reach class 2, then 4 years to reach class 3, then 6 years to reach class 4, and then 8 years to reach class 5 (for a total of 20 years). The earth node functions as akin to any other earth node as described in this document and is subject to potential modification, damage, and destruction in the same ways. Improving the size and strength of an artificially created earth node in this way beyond class 5 requires even more esoteric knowledge and powerful magic beyond the scope of this ritual. 

## Other Properties of Earth Nodes

Besides the properties and powers of earth nodes as mentioned and described above, it is possible for earth nodes to have other properties or idiosyncrasies as determined by the DM. Perhaps a particular earth node lacks some of the properties above, or grants additional powers, or may require a specific ritual to access. A DM should feel free to customize or alter the specifics of a particular earth node of their creation as suits their storyline beyond the guidelines mentioned in this document.

## Earth Nodes on Other Planes of Existence

Besides earth nodes encountered on the Material Plane, other planes of existence can also contain earth nodes, most commonly the Feywild and the Shadowfell as reflections of the Material Plane. At times, an earth node in the Material Plane may be linked to a mirroring earth node on the Feywild or the Shadowfell. Earth nodes are also common in the Elemental Plane of Earth, wherever streams of magical energy form a nexus of power. Such earth nodes have many of the same properties and powers associated with earth nodes on the Material Plane, but often carry additional properties tied to the plane of existence in which they reside. For example, an earth node in the Feywild might act as a wild magic zone.


## Other Kinds of Nodes

Earth nodes are the most common kind of node that are encountered, but other kinds of nodes exist that act as nexuses of magical energy. The following describe some other kinds of nodes known to exist. These nodes have many of the same properties and powers as associated with earth nodes, but also have important features that distinguish them from earth nodes or other kinds of nodes.

### Elemental Nodes

An elemental node in the Material Plane is a location where an Elemental Plane connects to and touches upon the Material Plane. There are four basic elemental nodes, each tied to one of the main Elemental Planes: elemental air nodes, elemental earth nodes, elemental fire nodes, and elemental water nodes. Elemental nodes are charged with the energy of the plane they are linked to and contain sustained portals that lead to and from the Elemental Plane they are connected to. The area around an elemental node is altered and resembles an area of the associated Elemental Plane and takes on the properties of that plane. 

For example, an elemental air node might feature powerful gusts of wind that run through a cavern whereas an elemental earth node might be situated in a cavern littered with crystals charged with elemental energy and the area may continually rumble. Likewise, an elemental fire node may lie within a magma chamber filled with sweltering heat, while an elemental water node may feature rivers and waterfalls of rapid and rushing waters.

Particularly powerful elemental nodes can warp the environment around them to a degree so as to resemble natural disasters, generating tornados, earthquakes, wildfires, or even hurricanes in the region. In featuring such free-standing portals, elemental creatures hailing from the associated Elemental Plane can frequently be encountered. 

It is said that various cults dedicated to elemental powers such as elder elementals or even the Elemental Evils can harness the power of such elemental nodes to either act as a conduit to summon such powerful beings into the Material Plane or even to create magical weapons capable of wreaking widespread devastation. 

The properties and powers of elemental nodes function the same as earth nodes except as specified below.

**Elemental Nature** <br>The area of an elemental node is altered, reflecting the nature of the Elemental Plane it is linked to and with corresponding environmental effects and hazards. Elementals originating from the corresponding Elemental Plane can be found in the region and near the elemental node. The specifics of how an elemental node affects the region it is within is determined by the DM.

**Enhanced Spellcasting** <br>Spells whose type corresponds to a given elemental node (as determined by the DM) are easier to enhance with the node's magic, with the DC of the ability check equal to the node DC - 5. For example, a *fireball* spell is easier to enhance with an elemental fire node's magic.

**Teleporting to Other Nodes** <br>The portal created is linked to the nearest elemental node of the matching type that is within the portal's range.

**Portals to Other Planes of Existence** <br>Given the nature of elemental nodes, elemental nodes contain a free-standing portal that leads to and from the Elemental Plane to which they are linked, located at the origin of the node. These portals last indefinitely but otherwise behave similarly to and have properties as described above regarding portals to other planes of existence in relation to earth nodes.

**Modifying Elemental Nodes** <br>Elemental nodes are sustained by the portals which lie at their origin. So long as the portal remains intact, an elemental node's class rating cannot diminish nor can an elemental node be destroyed. It is far more likely for an elemental node's presence to warp the nature and terrain of anything constructed around it than vice versa.

**Creating Elemental Nodes** <br>The creation of an artificial elemental node can be accomplished in a number of ways, as may be accomplished by certain powerful elemental entities present on the Material Plane or through invoking powerful elemental magic. It is rumored that certain apocalyptic elemental cults have sought out certain magical weapons tied to the Elemental Evils. Through the use of these magical items, these cults seek a means by which to establish a foothold for the Elemental Planes to make their presence manifest on the Material Plane and also to allow the elemental forces they revere to enter the Material Plane. 

**Granted Spells** <br>The granted spells provided by an elemental node reflect the Elemental Plane to which the node is linked to. See the table below for a list of sample granted spells associated with each kind of elemental node.

### Evil Nodes

In places where unspeakable acts of evil have occurred, where shrines to dark deities and others exist, or where an exceptionally evil entity had enacted its influence, a concentration of evil energy can pool to form an evil node. 

As sites of powerful evil, the area of an evil node echoes the wickedness associated with it. Shadows may linger or move of their own accord, spells cast in the area often take on macabre aspects unintended by their casters, distant cries and wails from no discernible source may sometimes be heard, low-hanging fog that can take on unsettling shapes may be present, and the very stones may bleed. 

The pervasive evil of an evil node also affects creatures within its area, as they often find themselves more tempted to commit misdeeds. Creatures that prolong their stay in the area of an evil node may suffer from disturbed sleep and nightmares or even have their alignments shifted towards evil over time. Good creatures, especially clerics and paladins dedicated to the cause of good, may find evil nodes especially repulsive and difficult to abide for extended periods of time. 

Dark cults or particularly evil entities often construct lairs around an evil node, using it strengthen to their own power and position. In the event an evil node becomes known of, evil entities often fight over control of such areas.

The properties and powers of evil nodes function the same as earth nodes except as specified below.

**Evil Nature** <br>The area of an evil node is altered, reflecting the evils associated with it in the environment. Dark sights and sounds can be perceived, spells are altered to appear macabre, and the area is desecrated. An evil node also affects the mood and disposition of creatures in the area in various subtle or overt ways, with good creatures particularly troubled while remaining in the area for long.

The specifics of how an evil node affects the region it is within as well as creatures in its area is determined by the DM.

**Enhanced Spellcasting** <br>Good creatures find it more difficult to make use of the enhanced spellcasting afforded by evil nodes, with the DC of the ability check equal to the node DC + 5 for good creatures. 

**Teleporting to Other Nodes** <br>The portal created is linked to the nearest evil node that is within the portal's range. 

**Granted Spells** <br>Good creatures find it more difficult to access the granted spells associated with an evil node, with the DC of the ability check equal to the node DC + 5 for good creatures. The granted spells provided by an evil node are generally tied to a particular theme, such as death or darkness. See the table below for a list of sample granted spells associated with an evil node.

#### *Sample Evil Node Spells*

| Earth Node Class / Maximum Spell Level | Evil Node Spell |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | inflict wounds |
| 2 | ray of enfeeblement |
| 3 | animate dead |
| 4 | blight |
| 5 | enervation |
| 6 | circle of death |
| 7 | finger of death |
| 8 | Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting |
| 9 | power word kill |

**Imprisonment** <br>Evil nodes can contain creatures following the same rules for storing items, with the following differences. An evil node can contain any number of creatures in its extradimensional space whose combined total Hit Dice does not exceed 3 x (the evil node's class)<sup>2</sup>. (For example, a class 3 evil node can contain up to 27 Hit Dice worth of creatures) Storing creatures inside an evil node does not count against its capacity for storing objects nor vice versa. 

Only willing creatures can be imprisoned in an evil node, including those that have been charmed or possessed to be willing. An imprisoned creature is in a state of suspended animation as if under the effects of a *sequester* spell, except without a special end condition. The rules for storing or retrieving creatures from an evil node otherwise follows the same corresponding rules for storing and retrieving items.

**Modifying Evil Nodes** <br>Evil nodes are tied to forces of evil that linger long after the event or influence that precipitated them. Evil nodes in this regard are more likely and quicker to repair or reconstitute themselves, especially if strengthened by dark rituals or further acts of evil as determined by the DM. 

Using holy water or the *hallow* spell to purify desecrated ground may suppress the effects of an evil node in an area for no more than 24 hours, but is unlikely to permanently purify an evil node without extensive effort. Acts of singular and powerful goodness done in the area of an evil node may damage or destroy an evil node as determined by the DM. 

![](/Guides/assets/images/acidify-art-deviantfixed.jpg)
<span class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.artstation.com/acidify">Node Manifestestation by Acidify Art</a></span>

**Creating Evil Nodes** <br>Just as acts of singular goodness can damage or destroy evil nodes, acts of prime or ultimate evil can help to create one. As evil nodes are tied to forces of evil that often result from the wicked choices of creatures, the question of whether or not an evil node arose naturally or inadvertently generally comes down to intent. Often, an evil node is created as a natural course of events owing to a concentration of evil energy that results from particularly wicked acts, shrines to dark deities and other entities, or due to the lingering presence of a particularly evil creature. However, certain foul and profane rituals are known to exist by which an evil node can be intentionally created, themselves often involving acts of horrific evil and sacrifice as a means by which to stain the landscape with a concentration of evil energy so as to create an evil node.

**Evil Nodes and Ravenloft** <br>In the Domains of Dread in Ravenloft, sites of powerful and insidious evil can create what are known as **sinkholes of evil**. Similar to evil nodes, sinkholes of evil are areas especially tainted by acts of evil, which are pronounced owing to the morphic nature of the Shadowfell and the influence of the Dark Powers.

Sinkholes of evil can be of any size and have a number of different effects. Particularly powerful and evil creatures in the Domains of Dread, such as a darklord, may continually generate their own sinkholes of evil as an aura around them.

Sinkholes of evil are desecrated areas which are difficult to impossible to purify by typical means. Whenever a non-evil creature enters the area of a sinkhole of evil for the first time in 24 hours, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer from Shadowfell Despair (see Chapter 2 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The DC of the saving throw depends on strength of the sinkhole, as determined by the DM. While a non-evil creature remains within a sinkhole of evil, they have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid being frightened or suffering from madness. 

A DM may wish to treat some sinkholes of evil in Ravenloft as evil nodes in their own right. In addition to the properties described before, undead in the region of such an evil node gain a bonus to their saving throws against being turned, equal to the class rating of the evil node. The DC for the Wisdom saving throw against Shadowfell Despair is equal to 10 + the class rating of the evil node. 

<br>

### Shadow Nodes

A shadow node in the Material Plane is a lasting nexus of magical energy tied to the Shadowfell, in which the Plane of Shadow touches upon and connects to the Material Plane.  Shadow nodes can be found in areas removed from the sun and light, such as dark catacombs, dread caverns, or forgotten tombs. Some rare shadow nodes may exist exposed to the sky but continually shroud themselves in a miasma of darkness, obscuring the light of the sun to anything within.

Shadow nodes are suffused with the energies of the Shadowfell, with the Plane of Shadow "bleeding" into the region of the Material Plane where the shadow node is located. 

A permanent shadow crossing exists as a portal at the origin of a shadow node. The area surrounding a shadow node takes on qualities of the Shadowfell itself, with light sources dampened, magic in the area altered, and creatures hailing from the Shadowfell lurking through the area.

Some organizations and entities seek out shadow nodes as means by which to travel to and from the Shadowfell. Others incorporate them into lairs or shrines dedicated to deities of darkness and shadow, such as Mask, Shar, or the Raven Queen. It is rumored that some shadar-kai agents of the Raven Queen know of and maintain artificially created shadow nodes as a means by which to allow travel between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell. 

The properties and powers of shadow nodes function the same as earth nodes except as specified below.

**Dark Nature** <br>The area of a shadow node reflects the nature of the Shadowfell, with corresponding effects on the environment, magic, and the creatures within. Light struggles to shine, darkness is pervasive and overwhelming, and creatures in the area are susceptible to Shadowfell Despair. Sorrowsworn and other creatures of the Shadowfell can be commonly found in the area within and surrounding a shadow node. The specifics of how a shadow node affects the region it is within is determined by the DM. 

**Dampened Light** <br>All light sources in the area of a shadow node, including magical light, emit half the amount of light they normally do and last half as long. Additionally, anyone in the area of a layer of a shadow node attempting to cast a spell which produces light must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability in order to successfully cast the spell, with the DC of the ability check equal to 10 + the class rating of the shadow node layer. (A creature without a spellcasting ability instead makes an Intelligence check) On a failure, the slot is wasted and the spell fails.  

**Enhanced Spellcasting** <br>Illusion and necromancy spells as well as spells which can create areas of magical darkness or whose type corresponds to the Shadowfell (as determined by the DM) are easier to enhance with the node's magic, with the DC of the ability check equal to the node DC - 5. However, it is impossible to enhance spells which produce light with the node's magic. For example, a *shadow blade* spell is easier to enhance with a shadow node's magic, but a *wall of light* spell cannot be so enhanced. 

**Teleporting to Other Nodes** <br>The portal created is linked to the nearest shadow node that is within the portal's range. 

**Portals to Other Locations** <br>When creating a portal to another location, one can also choose to have the portal lead to the corresponding location in the Shadowfell, not the location on the Material Plane within the portal's range. 

**Portals to Other Planes of Existence** <br>Given the nature of shadow nodes, shadow nodes contain a free-standing portal that leads to and from the Shadowfell as a permanent shadow crossing. 

These portals last indefinitely but otherwise behave similarly to and have properties as described before regarding portals to other planes of existence in relation to earth nodes.

**Granted Spells** <br>The granted spells provided by a shadow node reflect the nature of the Shadowfell, often consisting of illusion or necromancy spells or spells which can create areas of magical darkness. A shadow node never grants spells which act to produce light. See the table below for a list of sample granted spells associated with a shadow node.

#### *Sample Shadow Node Spells*

| Earth Node Class / Maximum Spell Level | Shadow Node Spell |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | silent image |
| 2 | darkness |
| 3 | summon shadowspawn |
| 4 | shadow of moil |
| 5 | creation |
| 6 | eyebite |
| 7 | mirage arcane |
| 8 | maddening darkness |
| 9 | weird |


**Empowerment**  <br>A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** or the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift that has become **proficient** in their understanding of a given shadow node (following the same rules as described under "Studying Earth Nodes" on page 4) can spend a short rest within the area attempting to draw upon its energy to strengthen themselves. At the end of the short rest, the creature can make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the shadow node. (A mystic can use their Intelligence modifier for the Arcana check) 

On a failure, nothing happens and the creature cannot attempt to empower themselves in this way again until 24 hours pass. On a success, the creature harnesses the power of the shadow node and for the next hour, the creature gains a bonus to their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score equal to the shadow node's class rating. The creature's ability scores may increase in this way beyond 20, but not 30. The creature can apply this bonus to one ability score or distribute among their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution scores as they wish.

A creature can additionally choose to use less of the shadow node's power if they wish to, treating as if the creature was attempting the ability check against a node DC for a shadow node of a lower class rating of their choice and thereby gaining a bonus equal to that class rating.

A creature can't empower themselves in the same way again until 24 hours pass, and a shadow node can grant this benefit up to a number of creatures equal to its class rating per day. 

**Modifying Shadow Nodes** <br>Most shadow nodes are susceptible to any modifications which expose the shadow node to the prolonged presence of light, especially sunlight. Such modifications can permanently damage or ultimately destroy a shadow node, as determined by the DM.

**Creating Shadow Nodes** <br>The creation of a shadow node can be accomplished by certain powerful entities with an intimate connection to the Shadowfell, such as balhannoths or darkweavers, using their own ability to warp and modify the environment so as to invoke the power of the Shadowfell. Spellcasters that are skilled and knowledgeable in shadow magic can utilize specific rituals akin to the *Node Genesis* ritual as a means by which to establish a shadow node in an appropriate location.

## Node Supernatural Gifts

Earth nodes and other kinds of nodes create a number of different magical effects. However, accessing the full suite of powers associated with nodes requires extraordinary sense and training in using a node's magics. Whether as a result of extensive exposure and study to the magic of nodes or due to other special circumstances, creatures that possess the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gifts are able to take advantage of the full breadth of capabilities afforded by earth nodes and other kinds of nodes. These Supernatural Gifts follow the rules associated with the acquisition and use of Supernatural Gifts, as can be found on page 24 of the [Hawthorne Item List](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sxYFCO3HAhP8kAaVQsT3XoDksn8v7OgY/view)

## Earth Nodes At a Glance

The following summarizes information regarding the powers and properties of earth nodes. It serves as a "cheat sheet" and reference for players and DMs. For full details, refer to the section and page in this document corresponding to the entries below. For information regarding the modification or creation of nodes, refer to the corresponding sections of this document in detail. 

* [**Features of Earth Nodes**](#properties-of-earth-nodes) <br>Earth nodes are nexuses of magical energy that often dwell underground, though their power can extend partly or fully into the surface. 
* [**Properties of Earth Nodes**](#properties-of-earth-nodes) <br>Earth nodes come in classes from 1 - 9; the higher the class rating, the larger and stronger the earth node. Weaker earth nodes are more common than stronger earth nodes, with most earth nodes falling between class 1 to 5. Earth nodes of class 2 or higher consist of nested circular layers, with each layer having its own class layer. The innermost layer has the highest rating, equal to the class rating of the earth node as a whole, with each layer beyond it having a class rating of one less than the layer before it. 
* [**Sensing Earth Nodes**](#sensing-earth-nodes) <br>Creatures that approach within 30 feet of an earth node can detect it with passive or active DC 15 spellcasting ability check or an Intelligence check if they aren't spellcasters. Those with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift can make an Arcana check. The *detect magic* and *commune with nature* spells automatically detect an earth node in range. Fully mapping an earth node's boundaries and layers takes time depending on the earth node's size.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Studying Earth Nodes**](#powers-of-earth-nodes) <br>Creatures can spend a short rest within an earth node and make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the node DC of the earth node to learn its pattern of magical energy as if learning the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle, becoming **proficient** in their understanding of that earth node. A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift and that is **proficient** in their understanding of an earth node can gain **expertise** by making an Arcana check with their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node at the end of each workweek until the number of total successes equals the earth node's class rating. (Each failure deducts 1 success, but the total can't go below 0) 
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Enhanced Spellcasting**](#enhanced-spellcasting) <br>Creatures can enhance spells while in the area of an earth node by succeeding on a spellcasting ability check (or an Intelligence check if they aren't spellcasters) against the node DC of the earth node layer they are in to increase the spell level their spells are cast at. This can be attempted against the node DC as if in a layer of a lower class rating for an easier check but less benefit. Those with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift can make an Arcana check. Mystics instead can gain a pool of psi points with an action they can do 1/day as if they had used their Psionic Mastery (doesn't count against the normal uses of the feature), with mystics with the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift are able to take this action 2/day. (An earth node grants this benefit to a number of mystics per day up to its class rating)
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Teleporting to a Known Earth Node**](#teleporting-to-a-known-earth-node) <br>Creatures that are **proficient** with an earth node can use *teleportation circle* or similar magic to teleport to that earth node.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Teleporting to Other Earth Nodes**](#teleporting-to-other-earth-nodes) <br>A creature that is **proficient** with an earth node can use the *teleportation circle* to create a *teleportation circle* portal to a specific or random earth node within a certain range.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Portals to Other Locations (Restricted)**](#portals-to-other-locations-restricted) <br>A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift and that has **expertise** with an earth node can, while in the earth node's area, use spells like *teleportation circle*, or *teleport* to create two-way portals to other locations on the same plane of existence within a certain range.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Portals to Other Planes of Existence**](#portals-to-other-planes-of-existence) <br>A creature that is **proficient** with an earth node learns what plane of existence beyond the Material Plane, if any, it is linked to. The creature can use spells or magic like *gate* or *plane shift* to open a two-way portal to that plane, with portals behaving similar to portals to other locations. Plane shift cast in this way doesn't require material components. 
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Granted Spells (Restricted)**](#granted-spells-restricted) <br>A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift can spend a short rest within an earth node and make an Arcana check with their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node to gain the ability to cast a number of spells using their spell slots for the next 24 hours. On a failure, nothing happens and they can't attempt this again until 24 hours later. A mystic with the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift makes an Intelligence (Arcana) check instead and can cast up to 5th-level granted spells without any components by using psi points.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Storing Items (Restricted)**](#storing-items-restricted) <br>All functions associated with this power can only be used by creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift. Objects can be stored in an earth node up to its storage capacity, and creatures that have studied an earth node's pattern of magcal energy can use an action to learn how much volume is being used up at that time. (The specific contents aren't learned, except for objects the creatures had previously stored themselves) Creatures can store objects in an earth node by making an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability (Intelligence in the case of mystics) against the node DC of the earth node to do so, causing the object to go into an extradimensional space. On a failure, nothing happens and the creature can't attempt to store that object again for 24 hours. Creatures can retrieve objects they've stored in an earth node from within the area of any earth node on the same plane of existence by using an action to make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability (Intelligence in the case of mystics) against the node DC of the original earth node. Creatures can attempt to retrieve a random stored object they hadn't stored while in an earth node by making an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability (Intelligence in the case of mystics) against the node DC of the earth node + the proficiency bonus of the creature who originally stored it.
* [**Powers of Earth Nodes: Locking Nodes (Restricted)**](#node-locking-restricted) <br>After a creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift has gained **expertise** with an earth node, the creature can use the *arcane lock* spell while in the earth node's area to magically secure it: the effective node DC of the earth node by 10 for other creatures that interact with the earth node. Other creatures can be designated at the time of casting to be able to normally interact with the earth node. Removing a node lock requires a *dispel magic* spell in the area targeting the magical effect, treated as if attempting to dispel a spell of a spell level equal to the earth node's class rating.
